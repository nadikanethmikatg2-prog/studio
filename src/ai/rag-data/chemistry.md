**Message from the Director General**

The National Institute of Education takes opportune steps from time to time for the
development of quality in education. Preparation of supplementary resource books for
respective subjects is one such initiative.

Supplementary resource books have been composed by a team of curriculum developers of the
National Institute of Education, subject experts from the national universities and experienced
teachers from the school system. Because these resource books have been written so that they
are in line with the G. C. E. (A/L) new syllabus implemented in 2017, students can broaden
their understanding of the subject matter by referring these books while teachers can refer them
in order to plan more effective learning teaching activities.

I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the staff members of the National Institute of
Education and external subject experts who made their academic contribution to make this
material available to you.

**Message from the Director**

Since 2017, a rationalized curriculum, which is an updated version of the previous curriculum
is in effect for the G.C.E (A/L) in the general education system of Sri Lanka. In this new
curriculum cycle, revisions were made in the subject content, mode of delivery and curricular
materials of the G.C.E. (A/L) Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Several alterations in the
learning teaching sequence were also made. A new Teachers’ Guide was introduced in place
of the previous Teacher’s Instruction Manual. In concurrence to that, certain changes in the
learning teaching methodology, evaluation and assessment are expected. The newly introduced
Teachers’ Guide provides learning outcomes, a guideline for teachers to mould the learning
events, assessment and evaluation.

When implementing the previous curricula, the use of internationally recognized standard
textbooks published in English was imperative for the Advanced Level science subjects. Due
to the contradictions of facts related to the subject matter between different textbooks and
inclusion of the content beyond the limits of the local curriculum, the usage of those books was
not convenient for both teachers and students. This book comes to you as an attempt to
overcome that issue.

As this book is available in Sinhala, Tamil, and English, the book offers students an opportunity
to refer the relevant subject content in their mother tongue as well as in English within the
limits of the local curriculum. It also provides both students and teachers a source of reliable
information expected by the curriculum instead of various information gathered from the other
sources.

This book authored by subject experts from the universities and experienced subject teachers
is presented to you followed by the approval of the Academic Affairs Board and the Council
of the National Institute of Education. Thus, it can be recommended as a material of high
standard.

**Introduction**
Chemistry is the study of the properties and behaviour of matter. **Matter** is the physical
material of the universe; it is anything that has mass and occupies space.

Although the materials in our world vary greatly in their properties, everything is formed
from only about 100 elements and, therefore, from only about 100 chemically different
kinds of atoms. (118 elements have been discovered so far but the heavier atoms are short
lived and not found naturally.)

**1.1 The atomic theory of matter**
Philosophers from the earliest times speculated about the nature of the fundamental
components from which the world is made. **Empedocles** (~ 440 BC) believed that the
four elements-earth, fire, air and water made up all things. The Hindus believed that the
four elements stated above makeup the world and space. However, **Democritus** (460–
370 BC) and other early Greek philosophers described the material world as being made
up of tiny, invisible, indivisible particles that they called ‘atomos’, meaning “indivisible”
or “uncuttable.”

Later, however, **Plato** and **Aristotle** formulated the notion that there can be no ultimately
indivisible particles, and the “atomic” view of matter faded for many centuries during
which Aristotelean philosophy dominated the Western culture.

It	was	in	1808	that	an	English	scientist	and	school	teacher,	 **John Dalton** (1766-1844),
formulated a precise definition of the indivisible building blocks of matter that we call
atoms. Dalton’s atomic theory was based on four postulates.

1. Elements	are	made	out	of	extremely	small,	indivisible	particles	called	atoms.
2. All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and size, but the atoms of one
    element are different from the atoms of all other elements.
3. Atoms of one element cannot be changed into atoms of a different element by
    chemical reactions; atoms are neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions.
4. Compounds are formed by union of two or more atoms of different elements in a
    simple numerical ratio.

Dalton’s atomic model is called the "Golf ball model".

Johnstone G. Stoney (1826-1911) named the fundamental unit carrying electricity as
“electrons” in 1891 but did not have any experimental evidence of its existence. During
the mid-1800s, scientists began to study electrical discharge through a glass tube pumped
almost empty of air. This device was an invention of the British chemist and physicist Sir
William Crookes (1832-1919) and is called Crookes tube or cathode ray tube.
```
```
Figure 1.2 A cathode ray tube
```
```
The experiment of Crookes and the others showed that when two electrodes are connected
to a high-voltage source, the heated negatively charged plate, called the cathode, produced
a stream of invisible radiation. Although the rays could not be seen, their presence was
detected because they cause gases at low pressure to glow and which made other
substances to fluoresce, or to give off light. The radiation emitted from the cathode was
given the name ' cathode rays '.
```
```
Later it was known that these rays could be deflected by a magnetic field and they carried
a negative electrical charge. Some scientists felt that these rays were waves and others
were inclined to think they were particles.
```
```
The British scientist J. J. Thomson (1856–1940) observed that cathode rays are the same
regardless of the identity of the cathode material or the gas in the tube. In 1897 he
described cathode rays as streams of negatively charged particles. He used a cathode tube
with an anode that had a hole at the centre. Using experimental measurements obtained
from that cathode tube he then calculated a value of 1.76 × 10^8 coulombs per gram
(C g-1) for the ratio of the electron’s electrical charge to its mass.

**1.1.1Properties of cathode rays (Experimental observations)**
 Cathode rays travel in straight lines. When an opaque object like a metal cross is
placed in the path of cathode rays in a discharge tube, a shadow with sharp edges
of the metal cross is formed at the end opposite to the cathode. The placement of
the shadow proves that cathode rays emit from the cathode and they travel in a
straight line.

```
Figure 1.4 Cathode ray properties
```
```
 Cathode rays are a beam of particles having mass and possess kinetic energy. On
placing a light paddle wheel in the path of cathode rays in a discharge tube, the
blades of the paddle wheel rotate. This was considered evidence that electrons
(cathode rays) have momentum.
(However, there is doubt on this conclusion as heating of the tube can also make
the paddles move.)
 When an electric field is applied in the path of cathode rays, they are deflected
towards the positively charged plate. Hence the cathode rays are composed of
negatively charged particles. They are affected by magnetic fields showing a
deflection perpendicular to the magnetic field. The direction of deflection is similar
to the deflection of any other negatively charged particles. Therefore, electron can
be concluded as a negatively charged particle too.

 The nature of the cathode rays does not depend on the nature of the gas taken in the
discharge tube or the material of the cathode.
 The ratio of the charge to mass (e/m ratio) of cathode ray particles obtained from
different gases was found to be exactly the same.

Figure 1.6 J. J. Thomson and his model
```
```
Using his findings in 1899 J.J. Thomson postulated the “plum-pudding” model of atomic
structure. In 1909, Robert Millikan (1868–1953) succeeded in measuring the charge of
an electron as 1.602 × 10 -19 C by performing the oil drop experiment. The mass of the
electron could be calculated by using the experimental values for the charge of electron
and Thomson’s charge-to-mass ratio.
```
```
Figure 1.7 Robert Millikan and mass of an electron
```
```
This mass is about 1/1837 of a hydrogen atom which is the lightest atom. The relative
charge of an electron is -.
```
```
1.1.2The nucleus of the atom
The German physicist, Eugen Goldstein experimentally proved the existence of positive
charges in matter. In his experiments, a perforated cathode was used in a discharge tube
along with air at very low pressure. When a high voltage of about 10,000 volts was applied
across the electrodes, a faint red glow was observed behind the perforated cathode. When
the high voltage is applied, its electric field accelerates the small number of ions present

in the gas. These collide with atoms of the gas, knocking electrons off of them and
creating more positive ions. These ions and electrons in turn strike more atoms, creating
more positive ions. The positive ions are all attracted to the cathode, and some pass
through the holes in the cathode. Goldstein called these positive rays "canal rays", because
they were produced by the holes or channels in the cathode. Although the rays are not
exactly	formed	at	the	positive	electrode	or	anode,	since	they	are	formed	away	from	the	
cathode close to the anode, they were also known as anode rays or positive rays.

```
Figure 1.8 A cathode ray tube with a perforated cathode
```
**1.1.3 Properties of positive rays (Experimental observations)**
 They travel in straight lines and cast a shadow of the objects placed in their way.
 They can move a paddle wheel placed in their path.
 These rays are positively charged and when an electric field is applied in the path
of the rays, they are deflected towards the negative plate of an electric field.
 The nature of the positive rays depends upon the gas taken in the discharge tube.
Different gases give different types of positive rays, which contain particles having
different masses and different charges. Therefore, the e/m ratio is not constant for
positive ray particles obtained from different gases.

In 1907 a study of how this "ray" was deflected in a magnetic field, revealed that the
particle making up the ray were not all the same mass. The lightest ones, formed when
there was some hydrogen gas in the tube, were calculated to be about 1840 times heavier
than an electron. The mass of any other positive particle is a multiplication of the mass of
the lightest positive particle. Therefore, it should be a subatomic particle. They were
named as protons. The relative mass of a proton is 1, hence, the **mass of a proton is
1.6 × 10-24 g** or **1.007276 u (atomic mass units) or Da (Daltons)**. (The unit was earlier
given the name amu.)

The proton has a charge equal and opposite to that of an electron. Hence the absolute

in the gas. These collide with atoms of the gas, knocking electrons off of them and
creating more positive ions. These ions and electrons in turn strike more atoms, creating
more positive ions. The positive ions are all attracted to the cathode, and some pass
through the holes in the cathode. Goldstein called these positive rays "canal rays", because
they were produced by the holes or channels in the cathode. Although the rays are not
exactly	formed	at	the	positive	electrode	or	anode,	since	they	are	formed	away	from	the	
cathode close to the anode, they were also known as anode rays or positive rays.

**1.1.3 Properties of positive rays (Experimental observations)**
 They travel in straight lines and cast a shadow of the objects placed in their way.
 They can move a paddle wheel placed in their path.
 These rays are positively charged and when an electric field is applied in the path
of the rays, they are deflected towards the negative plate of an electric field.
 The nature of the positive rays depends upon the gas taken in the discharge tube.
Different gases give different types of positive rays, which contain particles having
different masses and different charges. Therefore, the e/m ratio is not constant for
positive ray particles obtained from different gases.

In 1907 a study of how this "ray" was deflected in a magnetic field, revealed that the
particle making up the ray were not all the same mass. The lightest ones, formed when
there was some hydrogen gas in the tube, were calculated to be about 1840 times heavier
than an electron. The mass of any other positive particle is a multiplication of the mass of
the lightest positive particle. Therefore, it should be a subatomic particle. They were
named as protons. The relative mass of a proton is 1, hence, the **mass of a proton is
1.6 × 10-24 g** or **1.007276 u (atomic mass units) or Da (Daltons)**. (The unit was earlier
given the name amu.)

The proton has a charge equal and opposite to that of an electron. Hence the absolute
charge of a proton is 1.6 × 10-19 coulomb and its charge is positive. Proton is the smallest
positive charge carrying particle in an atom and the **relative charge of proton is +1.**

Following the discovery of radioactivity in 1896 by the French scientist Henri
Becquerel(1852–1908), the British physicist Lord Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937)
showed that radioactive materials produce three types of emissions alpha (), beta ()
and gamma (). The paths of  and  radiation are bent by an electric field.
```
```
Alpha (  ) rays consist of positively charged particles, called  particles, and therefore
are deflected away from the positively charged plate. Beta (  ) rays or particles have
the identity of electrons and are deflected away from the negatively charged plate. The
third type of radioactive radiation consists of high–energy rayscalled gamma (  ) rays.
Like X rays,  rays have no charge and are not affected by an external electric or
magnetic field.

1.1.4Rutherford’s gold foil experiment
In 1908-09, Rutherford together with his associate Johannes Hans Wilhelm Geiger
(1882-1945) a German physicist and an undergraduate named Ernest Marsden , carried
out a series of experiments using very thin foils of gold and other metals as targets for
particles from a radioactive source.

They observed that the majority of particles penetrated the foil either undeflected or only
with a slight deflection. They also noticed that a few particles were scattered (or
deflected) at a large angle. Very few  particles bounced back in the direction from which
it came.

To explain the results of the experiment, Rutherford devised a new model of atomic
structure, suggesting that most of the atom must be empty. This structure would allow
most of the  particles to pass through the gold foil with little or no deflection. The atom’s
positive charges, Rutherford proposed, are all concentrated in the **nucleus** **_,_** a dense central
core within the atom_._ Whenever an  particle came close to a nucleus in the scattering
experiment, it experienced a large repulsive force and therefore a large deflection.
Moreover, an  particle traveling directly toward a nucleus would experience an
enormous repulsion that could completely reverse the direction of the moving particle.

Subsequent studies, mainly based on mass spectroscopy revealed that the masses of atoms
were much greater than the masses of protons and electrons present. Therefore, another
```
```
subatomic particle should be present to contribute towards the mass of the atom. In
Sir James Chadwick (1891-1972) a British scientist discovered the ‘neutron’. The
charge of a neutron is 0 (zero) and its mass is 1.6749 ×10-24g or 1.008665 amu.

Since Rutherford’s time, physicists have learned more and more about atomic nuclei. In
1913 Niels Henrik David Bohr (1885-1962) a Danish physicist, combined the ideas at
that time and suggested that the atomic nucleus was surrounded by electrons moving in
orbit, like planets around the sun. He postulated that the electrons in order to remain in
orbit, the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and electron must be equal to the
centrifugal force. In other words, the electrons have to travel in a constant speed around
the nucleus keeping the distance from the nucleus constant. The model he introduced is
known as the Rutherford–Bohr model or the Bohr model. Particles found in the nucleus
are called nucleons , including the protons and neutrons in to the atom. A nuclide is the
nucleus of an atom that has specific numbers of protons and neutrons (all nucleons ).
Therefore, nuclides are composite particles of nucleons.

**1.1.5Atomic number, isotopes and mass number
Henry Gwynn Jeffrey Moseley (1887-1915)** ,	an	English	physicist	and	a	co-worker of
Rutherford, found that the number of positive charges on the nucleus increases in atoms
by single electron units. The atoms of each element have a characteristic number of
protons. The number of protons in an atom of any particular element is called that
element’s **atomic number.**

```
= =
```
Since an atom has no net electrical charge, the number of electrons it contains is equal to
the	number	of	protons	found	in	its	nucleus.	All	atoms	of	carbon,	for	example,	have	six	
protons	and	six	electrons,	whereas	all	atoms	of	oxygen	have	eight	protons	and	eight	
electrons.	Thus,	carbon	has	atomic	number	6	and	oxygen	has	atomic	number	8.	

British scientists **J. J. Thomson** and **Francis William Aston (1877-1945)** perfected the
‘mass spectrometer' which they used in 1912-13 to discover the first isotopes (of neon).

Atoms of a given element can differ in the number of neutrons they contain and therefore
their mass can also vary. The number of protons plus neutrons (nuclide) in an atom is
called its **mass number.**

In the atomic symbol used to represent a particular atom the mass number is given at the
top left of the element symbol and the atomic number may be given at the bottom left.
However, since the symbol also gives the same information, the atomic number usually

1.1.6The atomic mass scale
Atoms are very small pieces of matter; however, they have a mass. However, it is
convenient to use the unified atomic mass unit (u) when	dealing	with	these	extremely	
small masses, where;
```
```
The	unified	atomic	mass	unit	is	defined	as	a	mass	of	exactly	1/12	of	a	chemically	unbound	
atom of the^12 C isotope of carbon. In these units, a^1 H atom has a mass of 1.0078 u or Da
and a^16 O atom has a mass of 15.9949 u or Da.

1.1.7Average atomic mass and relative atomic mass of an element
Most	elements	occur	in	nature	as	mixtures	of	isotopes.	The	mass	of	an	atom	can	be	given	
as relativeatomic mass or atomic mass. It can be obtained by summing over the masses
of its isotopes multiplied by their relative abundances:
```
```
Example 1.1

```
How many protons, neutrons and electron are there in an atom of^197 Au?
```
```
Answer:
```
```
The superscript 197 is the mass number (protons + neutrons). According to the
periodic table gold has atomic number 79. Hence, an atom of 197 Au has 79 protons,
79 electrons and 197-79 = 118 neutrons.

When the atomic mass is given as mass per mole of atoms (in units of **g mol-1** ), it is known
as the **molar mass** of the element or atom.

Since 1 g = 6.02214 × 10^23 u and 1 mole of atoms = 6.02214 × 10^23 atoms, the molar mass
of carbon will be 12.01 g mol-1.

**Relative atomic mass** ( **_A_** **r** ) is a dimensionless physical quantity. It is the ratio of the
average mass of atoms of an element to^1 ⁄ 12 the mass of an atom of carbon-12 (known as
the unified atomic mass unit). Hence the relative atomic mass of carbon will be 12.01.

In periodic tables the relative atomic mass of the element is usually given below the
symbol of the element.

**1.1.8 Ions**
The nucleus of an atom is unchanged by chemical processes, but some atoms can readily
gain or lose electrons. If electrons are removed from or added to an atom, a charged
particle called an **ion** is formed. An ion with a positive charge is a **cation** and a negatively
charged ion is an **anion**.

(EMR)	 consists	 of	 electromagnetic waves , which are synchronized oscillations of
electric and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light through a vacuum. The

types of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum at a speed of

Waves are periodic, which means that the pattern of peaks and troughs repeats itself at
regular intervals. The distance between two adjacent peaks or between two adjacent
troughs (distance between a cycle) is called the **wavelength (**  **)**. The number of complete
wavelengths, or cycles, that pass a given point each second is the **frequency (**  **)** of the

1.2.1 Quantization of energy
In 1900 a German physicist named Max Planck (1858–1947) proposed that energy is
quantized; that is the energy can be either released or absorbed by atoms only in discrete
quantities of some minimum size. Planck gave the name quantum (meaning “fixed
amount”) to the smallest quantity of energy that can be emitted or absorbed as
electromagnetic radiation. He proposed that the energy E , of a single quantum equals a
constant time the frequency of the radiation:
```

The constant h is called Planck constant and has a value of 6.626 × 10-34 J s.

De Broglie suggested that an electron moving about the nucleus of an atom behaves like
a wave and therefore has a wavelength. He proposed that the wavelength of the electron,
or of any other particle, depends on its mass, m , and on its velocity, :
```
```
where h is the Planck constant. The quantity 𝑚𝑚v for any object is called its momentum
( p ).
```
```
Because de Broglie’s hypothesis is applicable to all matter, any object of mass ( m) and
velocity(v) would give rise to a characteristic matter wave. However, the wavelength
associated with an object of ordinary size, such as a golf ball, is so tiny as to be completely
unobservable. This is not so for an electron because its mass is so small.

1.3 Electronic energy levels of atoms
The ionization energy of an atom or ion is the minimum energy required to remove an
electron from the ground state of the isolated gaseous atom or ion. The magnitude of the
ionization energy tells us how much energy is required to remove an electron; the greater
the ionization energy, the more difficult it is to remove an electron.
```
```
The ionization energies for a given element increase as successive electrons are removed.
This trend is because with each successive removal, an electron is being pulled from an
increasingly more positive ion, requiring increasingly more energy.
```
```
The sharp increase in ionization energy that occurs when an inner-shell electron is
removed is a clear evidence for the fact that electrons are in discrete energy levels.

**1.3.1 The hydrogen spectrum**
Most common radiation sources, including light bulbs and stars, produce radiation
containing many different wavelengths. A **spectrum** is produced when radiation from
such sources is separated into its component wavelengths. This range of colours,
containing light of all wavelengths, is called a **continuous spectrum**. Not all radiation
sources produce a continuous spectrum. When a high voltage is applied to tubes that
contain different gases under reduced pressure, the gases emit different colours of light.
For example, the light emitted by neon gas is the familiar red-orange glow of many “neon”
lights. When light emitted from such tubes is passed through a prism, only a few
wavelengths are present in the resultant spectrum. A spectrum containing radiation of
only specific wavelengths is called a **line spectrum.**

```
Figure 1.22 Line spectrum of hydrogen
```
Scientists studied the line spectrum of hydrogen thoroughly in the mid-1800s. At that
time, only four lines at wavelengths of 410 nm (violet), 434 nm (blue) 486 nm (blue-
green) and 656 nm (red) were observed in the spectrum.

Bohr's atomic model together with Planck’s idea that energies are quantized was capable
of explaining the line spectrum of hydrogen.

Figure 1.23 Possible electron emissions in hydrogen

Each allowed orbit around the atom corresponds to a different value of n ( n is a whole
number). The radius of the orbit gets larger as n increases. Thus, the first allowed orbit
(the one closest to the nucleus) has n = 1, the next allowed orbit (the one second closest
to the nucleus) has n = 2, and so forth.
```
```
The line spectra are the result of emission when electrons fall from an initial energy level
( n i) to a final energy level ( n f), so E photon = h  = hc/  = -  E = -( E f - E i) for these
transitions.  E is negative for emission as n f is less than n i; the electron is falling in energy
to a lower-energy orbit. The possible emissions results in the line spectra seen in
hydrogen.

Each	 p subshell has three orbitals, corresponding to the three allowed values of ml : -1, 0
and +1. The electron density is not distributed spherically as in an s orbital. Instead, the
density is concentrated in two regions on either side of the nucleus, separated by a node
at the nucleus. This dumbbell-shaped orbital has two lobes.
```
```
For each value of n, the three p orbitals have the same size and shape but differ from one
another in spatial orientation. It is convenient to label these as px, py, and pz orbitals where
the	letter	subscript	indicates	the	Cartesian	axis	along	which	the	orbital	is	oriented.

1.3.3 Orbitals and quantum numbers
The Bohr model introduced a single quantum number, n , to describe an orbit. The
quantum mechanical model uses three quantum numbers, n , l and ml , which result
naturally from the mathematics used to describe an orbital that electrons occupy in an
atom and ms that describes the spin of the electron.
```
**1. The principal quantum number** **_n_** **,** can have positive integral values 1, 2, 3,.... This
    quantum number defines the main energy level (electron shell) that the electron
    occupies in the atom. As _n_ increases, the orbital becomes larger, and the electron
    spends more time further from the nucleus.
**2. The angular momentum (or azimuthal) quantum number** **_l_** _,_ can have integral
    values from 0 to ( _n_ - 1) for each value of _n_. This quantum number defines the shape of
    the orbital. The value of **_l_** for a particular orbital is generally designated by the letters
    _s_ , _p_ , _d_ and _f_ corresponding to _l_ values of 0, 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
    The set of orbitals that have the same _n_ and _l_ values is called a **subshell** .	Each	subshell
    is designated by a number (the value of _n_ ) and a letter ( _s_ , _p_ , _d_ or _f_ corresponding to the
    value of _l_ ).	For	example,	the	orbitals	that	have	 _n_ = 3 and _l_ = 2 are called 3 _d_ orbitals
    and are in the 3 _d_ subshell.


**G.**^ **C.**^ **E. (A/L) CHEMISTRY: Unit**^1^ **Atomic Structure**^

**3. The magnetic quantum number** **_ml_** **,** can have integral values between - _l_ and _l_ ,
    including zero. This quantum number describes the orientation of the orbital in space
    and the number of possible values for _l_ denotes the number of orbitals in the subshell.
    For example, for _l_ = 2 the values possible will be 2, 1, 0, -1 and -2 denoting that a _d_
    subshell has five orbitals.
**4. The spin quantum number** **_ms_**. Two possible values are allowed for _ms_ , + ½ or -1/ 2,
    which indicate the two opposite directions in which the electron can spin. A spinning
    charge produces a magnetic field. The two opposite directions of spin therefore
    produce oppositely directed magnetic fields.

The restrictions on possible values for quantum numbers give rise to the following very
important observations:

1. The shell with principal quantum number _n_ consists	 of	 exactly	 _n_ subshells.	 Each	
    subshell corresponds to a different allowed value of _l_ from 0 to ( _n_ - 1). Thus, the first
    shell ( _n_ = 1) consists of only one subshell, the 1 _s_ ( _l_ = 0); the second shell ( _n_ = 2)
    consists of two subshells, the 2 _s_ ( _l_ = 0) and 2 _p_ ( _l_ = 1); the third shell consists of three
    subshells, 3 _s_ , 3 _p_ , and 3 _d_ , and so forth.
2.	Each	subshell	consists	of	a	specific	number	of	orbitals.	Each	orbital	corresponds	to	a	
    different allowed value of _ml_. For a given value of _l_ , there are (2 _l_ + 1) allowed values
    of _ml_ , ranging from - _l_ to + _l_. Thus, each _s_ ( _l_ = 0) subshell consists of one orbital; each
    _p_ ( _l_ = 1) subshell consists of three orbitals; each _d_ ( _l_ = 2) subshell consists of five
    orbitals, and so forth.

    and the number of possible values for _l_ denotes the number of orbitals in the subshell.

3. The total number of orbitals in a shell is _n_^2 , where _n_ is the principal quantum number
    of the shell. The resulting number of orbitals for the shells 1, 4, 9 and 16 is related to
    a pattern seen in the periodic table: We see that the number of elements in the rows of
    the periodic table 2, 8, 18 and 32 equals twice these numbers.

```
1.4 Electron configuration
When considering the electronic structures of atoms: In a many-electron atom, for a given
value of n , the energy of an orbital increases with increasing value of l. For example,
n = 3 orbitals increase in energy in the order 3 s < 3 p < 3 d and all orbitals of a given
subshell (such as the five 3 d orbitals) have the same energy, just as they do in the
hydrogen atom. Orbitals with the same energy are said to be degenerate.
```
```
1.4.1 The Aufbau principle
The filling of electrons in an atom begins with the subshell lowest energy and continues
upwards according to the “Aufbau principle” (The German word 'Aufbau' means 'building
up').
```
```
Figure 1.27 Sequence of filling of electrons
Thus, the general order of energies of energy levels and sub energy levels are shown in
Figure 1.28.

**1.4.2The Pauli exclusion principle**
The **Pauli Exclusion Principle,** which was postulated by **Wolfgang Pauli** in 1925, states
that _no_ two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers _n_ , _l_ , _ml_ ,
and _ms._

For a given orbital, the values of _n_ , _l_ , and _ml_ are fixed. Thus, if we want to put more than
one electron in an orbital andsatisfy the Pauli Exclusion Principle, our only choice is to
assign different _ms_ values to the electrons. This indicates that an orbital can hold a
maximum of two electrons and they must have opposite spins. This restriction allows us
to index the electrons in an atom by giving their quantum numbers.

Thus, each _s_ subshell which consists of one orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons;
each _p_ subshell that consists of three orbitals can hold a maximum of six electrons; each
_d_ subshell which consists of five orbitals can hold a maximum of ten electrons, and so
forth.

Electrons are distributed among the various orbitals of an atom based on the relative
energies of orbitals and the Pauli Exclusion Principle and this distribution is called the
**electron configuration** of the atom. The most stable electron configuration, known as
the ground state, is that in which the electrons are in the lowest possible energy states.

According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle however, there can be only two electrons in
any single orbital. Thus, the orbitals are filled in the order of increasing energy, with no
more than two electrons per orbital.

For example, in the lithium atom, which has three electrons, the 1 _s_ orbital can
accommodate two electrons. The third one goes into the next lowest-energy orbital, the
2 _s_.

Any electron configuration can be represented by writing the symbol for the occupied
subshell and adding a superscript to indicate the number of electrons in that subshell. For
example, for lithium we write 1 s^22 s^1 and for sodium 1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^1.
```
```
In another representation, called an orbital diagram , each orbital is denoted by a box or
circle and each electron by a half arrow/ full arrow. A half/ full arrow pointing up
represents an electron with a positive spin magnetic quantum number ( ms = +1/2) and a
half/ full arrow pointing down represents an electron with a negative spin magnetic
quantum number ( ms = -1/2).
```
```
Electrons having opposite spins are said to be paired when they are in the same orbital.
An unpaired electron is one not accompanied by a partner of opposite spin.
```
```
In the lithium atom the two electrons in the 1 s orbital are paired and the electron in the 2 s
orbital is unpaired.
```
```
1.4.3 Hund’s rule
The Hund’s rule states that for degenerate orbitals, the lowest energy is attained when the
number of electrons having the same spin is maximized.
```
```
This means that electrons occupy orbitals singly to the maximum extent possible and that
these single electrons in a given subshell all have the same spin magnetic quantum
number. Electrons arranged in this way are said to have parallel spins.
```
```
e.g. Carbon atom; the two 2 p electrons singly occupy two of the three 2 p orbitals and they
will be parallel to each other so that they can have the same spin.

**1.4.4 Condensed electron configurations**
The electron configuration (also known as the electron distribution) of sodium, atomic
number 11, is written as 1 _s_^22 _s_^22 _p_^63 _s_^1. However, the filling of the 2 _p_ subshell is complete
at neon, which has a stable configuration with eight electrons (an _octet_ ) in the outermost
occupied shell. The next element, sodium, marks the beginning of a new row of the
periodic table. Sodium has a single 3 _s_ electron beyond the stable configuration of neon.
The configuration of sodium can therefore be abbreviated as [Ne] 3 _s_^1.

The part represented by the bracketed symbol is the noble-gas core of the atom. More
usually, these inner-shell electrons are referred to as the **core electrons**.

The electrons given after the noble-gas core are called the **outer-shell electrons** or
valence shell electrons. The outer-shell electrons include the electrons involved in
chemical bonding, as they are called the **valence electrons**.

Similarly, phosphorous, which has 15 electrons can be represented as 1 _s_^22 _s_^22 _p_^63 _s_^23 _p_^3 or
[Ne] 3 _s_^23 _p_^3.

**1.4.4 Condensed electron configurations**
The electron configuration (also known as the electron distribution) of sodium, atomic
number 11, is written as 1 _s_^22 _s_^22 _p_^63 _s_^1. However, the filling of the 2 _p_ subshell is complete
at neon, which has a stable configuration with eight electrons (an _octet_ ) in the outermost
occupied shell. The next element, sodium, marks the beginning of a new row of the
periodic table. Sodium has a single 3 _s_ electron beyond the stable configuration of neon.
The configuration of sodium can therefore be abbreviated as [Ne] 3 _s_^1.

The part represented by the bracketed symbol is the noble-gas core of the atom. More
usually, these inner-shell electrons are referred to as the **core electrons**.

The electrons given after the noble-gas core are called the **outer-shell electrons** or
valence shell electrons. The outer-shell electrons include the electrons involved in
chemical bonding, as they are called the **valence electrons**.

Similarly, phosphorous, which has 15 electrons can be represented as 1 _s_^22 _s_^22 _p_^63 _s_^23 _p_^3 or
[Ne] 3 _s_^23 _p_^3.

After the noble-gas element argon (1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^23 p^6 ), according to Aufbau principle, it is
not the 3 d but 4 s orbital that the next electron goes to. Hence, the element that follows
Argon, which is potassium (K) has the electronic configuration of 1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^23 p^64 s^1 or
[Ar]4 s^1. Calcium, with 20 electrons hence is written as 1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^23 p^6 4 s^2 or [Ar]4 s^2.
```
```
Following the complete filling of the 4 s orbital (this occurs in the calcium atom), the next
set of orbitals to be filled is the 3 d.
```
```
Once all the 3 d orbitals have been filled with two electrons each, the 4 p orbitals begin to
be occupied until the completed octet of outer electrons (4 s^24 p^6 ) is reached with krypton
(Kr), atomic number 36, another of the noble gases.
```
```
Elements with completely filled or precisely half-filled sub energy levels appear to be
relatively more stable than elements with other electron configurations. Thus elements
with configurations ending with s^2 , p^6 and d^10 will be more stable.
```
```
e.g.: Zn: [Ar]3 d^104 s^2 , Mg: [Ne]3 s^2 , Ar: [Ne]3 s^23 p^6 , N: [He]2 s^22 p^3 and Mn: [Ar]3 d^5 4 s^2
will be relatively stable atoms.
```
```
The electron configurations of certain elements appear to deviate from the rules of
configuration discussed. For an example, the electron configuration of chromium
(element 24) is [Ar]3 d^54 s^1 rather than [Ar]3 d^44 s^2 which we might expect. Similarly, the

configuration of copper (element 29) is [Ar]3 _d_^104 _s_^1 instead of [Ar]3 _d_^94 _s_^2 .This anomalous
behaviour is largely a consequence of the closeness of the 3 _d_ and 4 _s_ orbital energies. It
frequently occurs when there are enough electrons to form precisely half-filled sub energy
levels (as in chromium) or a completely filled sub energy levels (as in copper), that would
result in relatively stable configurations. (Note that the filling of the 3 _d_ orbitals occurs
after filling of 4 _s._ However, the electronic configuration is commonly written as 3 _d_ first
and then 4 _s_ ).

**1.5 Building of the periodic table**
The discovery of chemical elements has been ongoing since ancient times. Certain
elements, such as gold (Au), appear in nature in elemental form and were thus discovered
thousands of years ago. In contrast, some elements, such as technetium (Tc), are
radioactive and intrinsically unstable and were discovered after the development of
technology during the twentieth century.

As the number of known elements increased, scientists began classifying them. In 1869,
**Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev** in Russia and **Lothar Meyer** in Germany published nearly
identical classification schemes. Both noted that similar chemical and physical properties
occur periodically when the elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic mass.
Scientists at that time had no knowledge of atomic numbers. However with the
introduction of the concept of atomic number the modern periodic table was constructed.

The way in which the columns (groups) are labeled is somewhat arbitrary. The labeling
scheme widely used in the past had Arabic numerals and A and B designations. Thus the
numbers ran from 1A-8A and 1B-8B. The group headed by fluorine (F) hence was group
7A.

In a similar convention, the columns are numbered using Roman numerals rather than
Arabic numerals together with the letters A and B.

Since the total number of orbitals in each shell equals n^2 : 1, 4, 9 and 16 respectively and
because two electrons can be placed in each orbital, each shell accommodates up to 2 n^2
electrons: 2, 8, 18, or 32. The overall structure of the periodic table too reflects these
electron numbers: Each row of the table has 2, 8, 18 or 32 elements in it.
```
```
The periodic table can be further divided into four blocks based on the filling order of
orbitals.
```
```
Figure 1.31 Regions of the periodic table
```
```
The two columns of elements on the left known as the alkali metals (group 1) and alkaline
earth metals (group 2), are those in which the valence s orbitals are being filled. These
two columns make up the s block of the periodic table.
```
```
The block on the far right with six columns (group 13 to group 18) comprises the p block ,
where the valence p orbitals are being filled. The s block and the p block elements together
are the representative elements , sometimes called the main-group elements.
```
```
The block before the p - block in the Figure 1.31 has ten columns containing the transition
metals. However, the elements in 10th column are not considered as transition metals.
These are the elements in which the valence d orbitals are being filled and make up the d
block.
```
```
The elements in the two rows between and s block and d block, containing 14 columns
are the ones in which the valence f orbitals are being filled and make up the f block.
(However, filling of electrons and hence their electron configurations are complicated).
These elements are often referred to as the f block metals or inner transition elements.
```
```
The number of columns in each block corresponds to the maximum number of electrons
that can occupy each kind of subshell. Since that 2, 6, 10, and 14 are the numbers of
electrons that can fill the s , p , d and f subshells, respectively, the s block has 2 columns,
the p block has 6, the d block has 10 and the f block has 14.

**1.6 Periodic trends shown by** **_s_** **and** **_p_** **block elements**
Many properties of atoms depend on their electron configuration and on how strongly the
outer electrons in the atoms are attracted to the nucleus. Coulomb’s law tells us that the
strength of the interaction between two electrical charges depends on the magnitudes of
the charges and on the distance between them. Therefore, the attractive force between an
electron and the nucleus depends on the magnitude of the nuclear charge and on the
average distance between the nucleus and the electron. The force increases as the nuclear
charge increases and decreases as the electron moves further from the nucleus.

In an atom that containing a large number of electrons, in addition to the attraction of
each electron to the nucleus,	each	electron	experiences	a repulsion due to the	proximity	
of other electrons. These electron–electron repulsions cancel some of the attraction of the
electron	to	the	nucleus	so	that	the	electron	experiences	less	attraction	than	it	would if the
other electrons were not there. Each	electron	in	an	atom	is	said	to	be	screened	or	shielded	
from the nucleus by the other electrons and the phenomenon is hence termed the
**screening effect** or **shielding effect** of electrons. Therefore, all atoms show shielding
effect	except	hydrogen.

An electron, therefore, experiences	a	net	attraction by the nucleus that is less than it would
be in the absence of other electrons. This partially screened nuclear charge is termed the
**effective nuclear charge** , **_Z_** **eff**. The effective nuclear charge is always less than the actual
nuclear charge ( _Z_ eff < _Z)_.

For a valence electron, most of the shielding is due to the core electrons, which are much
closer to the nucleus. As a result, the greater the number of core electrons and the higher
the number of core shells, the greater will be the screening effect.

The effective nuclear charge increases from left to right across any period of the periodic
table. Although the number of core electrons stays the same across the period, the number
of protons increases. The valence electrons added to counterbalance the increasing
nuclear charge thus it screens ineffectively. Thus, _Z_ eff increases steadily across the period.

**1.6.1 Sizes of atoms and ions**
Atoms are not hard, spherical objects as many of us think. According to the quantum
mechanical model, atoms do not have sharply defined boundaries. We can define atomic
size in several ways, based on the distances between atoms in various situations.

**van der Waals radius**
The van der Waals radius (nonbonding atomic radius) refers to one half the distance
between two equivalent non-bonded atoms in their most stable arrangement, that is, where
attractive	forces	are	maximum.

A chemical bond is the attractive interaction between any two adjacent atoms in a
molecule. The two bonded atoms are closer together than they would be in a nonbonding
collision. The bonding atomic radius for any atom in a molecule is equal to half of the
bond distance (the distance between two bonded atoms). The bonding atomic radius (also
known as the covalent radius) is smaller than the nonbonding atomic radius.

Periodic trends in atomic radii
The atomic sizes within the periodic table show two interesting trends:
Within each group, the atomic radius tends to increase from top to bottom. This trend
results primarily from the increase in the principal quantum number ( n ) of the outer
electrons. As we go down a column, the outer electrons have a greater probability of being
further away from the nucleus, causing the atomic radius to increase.
Within each period, the atomic radius generally tends to decrease from left to right. The
major factor influencing this trend is the increase in effective nuclear charge across a
period. The increasing effective nuclear charge steadily draws the valence electrons closer
to the nucleus, causing the atomic radius to decrease.

Electron configurations of ions
When electrons are removed from an atom to form a cation, they are always removed first
from the occupied orbitals having the highest principal quantum number, n.
```
```
For	example, when one electron is removed from a sodium atom (1 s^22 s^22 p^63 s^1 ), it is the
3 s^1 electron that is removed.
```
Na(1 _s_^22 _s_^22 _p_^63 _s_^1 or [Ne]3 _s_^1 ) Na+(1 _s_^22 _s_^22 _p_^6 or [Ne]) + e

```
If there is more than one occupied subshell for a given value of n , the electrons are first
removed from the orbital with the highest value of l .	For	example,	a	boron atom loses its
2 p electron before it loses its 2 s electrons.
```
###### B(1 s^22 s^22 p^1 ) B+(1 s^22 s^2 ) + e

###### B+(1 s^22 s^2 ) B3+(1 s^2 ) + 2e

```
When two electrons are removed from Fe ([Ar]3 d^64 s^2 ), the 4 s^2 electrons are the ones that
are removed even though in filling the 4 s fills before the 3 d.
```
###### Fe([Ar]3 d^64 s^2 ) Fe2+([Ar]3 d^6 ) + 2e

```
If an additional electron is removed, forming Fe3+, it comes from a 3 d orbital because all
the orbitals with n = 4 are empty.
```
###### Fe2+([Ar]3 d^6 ) Fe3+([Ar]3 d^5 ) + e


**G.**^ **C.**^ **E. (A/L) CHEMISTRY: Unit**^1^ **Atomic Structure**^

Electrons added to an atom to form an anion are added to the empty or partially filled
orbital having the highest value of _n,_ which is the valence shell. For example, an electron
added to a fluorine atom to form the F- ion goes into the one remaining vacancy in the 2 _p_
subshell.

###### F(1 s^22 s^22 p^5 ) + e F-(1 s^22 s^22 p^6 )

**Periodic trends in ionic radii**
Like the size of an atom, the size of an ion depends on its nuclear charge, the number of
electrons it possesses, and the orbitals in which the valence electrons reside. When a
cation is formed from a neutral atom, electrons are removed from the occupied atomic
orbitals that are the most spatially extended from the nucleus. Also, when a cation is
formed the number of electron–electron repulsions is reduced. Therefore, cations are
smaller than their parent atoms.

```
Figure 1.35 Radii of cations and anions compared to parent atoms in pm
```
The opposite is true of anions. When electrons are added to an atom to form an anion, the
increased electron–electron repulsions cause the electrons to spread out more in space.
Thus, anions are larger than their parent atoms.

For ions carrying the same charge (both positively or negatively charged ions), ionic
radius increases as we move down a column in the periodic table. In other words, as the
principal quantum number of the outermost occupied orbital of an ion increases, the
radius of the ion increases.

An **isoelectronic series** is a group of ions/ atoms containing the same number of electrons.
For example, each ion/ atom in the isoelectronic series O2-, F-, Ne, Na+ and Mg2+ has a
total number of 10 electrons. In any isoelectronic series the nuclear charge increases with
increasing atomic number in the series. Because the number of electrons remains
constant, ionic radius decreases with increasing nuclear charge as the electrons are more
strongly attracted to the nucleus.

1.6.2Ionization energy
As explained at the beginning of section 1.3, the ionization energy of an atom or ion is
the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the ground state of the isolated
gaseous atom or ion.
```
```
In general, the first ionization energy (I 1 ) is the energy needed to remove the most loosely
bound electron from a neutral gaseous atom. For example, the first ionization energy for
the lithium atom is the energy required for the process;Li(g) Li+(g) + e
```
```
The second ionization energy (I 2 ) is the energy needed to remove the second loosely
bound electron of an atom from a gaseous monovalent cation to form a gaseous divalent
cation, and so forth, for successive removals of additional electrons. Thus, second
ionization energy for the lithium atom is the energy associated with the process;
Li+(g) Li2+(g) + e
```
```
The ionization energies for a given element increase as successive electrons are removed;
I 1 < I 2 < I 3 , and so forth. This trend is because with each successive removal, an electron
is being pulled away from an increasingly more positive ion, requiring increasingly more
energy. Furthermore, a sharp increase in ionization energy occurs when an inner-shell
electron is removed compared to the removal of outer shell electrons. This is because the
electrons of the inner shell are closer to the nucleus and hence are attracted to it more
strongly.

**Periodic trends in the first ionization energies**
The first ionization energy generally increases as we move across a period. The alkali
metals show the lowest ionization energy in each period, and the noble gases show the
highest.

Generally, the first ionization energy decreases as we move down any column in the
periodic table. For example, the ionization energies of the group 1 elements (alkali metals)
follow the following order

Li >Na > K > Rb > Cs > Fr.

The _s_ and _p_ block elements show a larger range of I **1** values than do the transition metal
elements. Generally, the ionization energies of the transition metals increase slightly from
left to right in a period.

The same factors that influence atomic size also influence ionization energies. The energy
needed to remove an electron from the outermost occupied shell depends on both the
effective nuclear charge and the average distance of the electron from the nucleus. Either
increasing the effective nuclear charge or decreasing the distance from the nucleus
increases the attraction between the electron and the nucleus. As this attraction increases,
it becomes more difficult to remove the electron, and thus the ionization energy increases.

Figure 1.38** Variation of the first ionization energies with atomic number of elements
The irregularities in the trend of the first ionization energy in a given period are small but
still readily explained. Removal of electrons from a completely filled subshell (e.g. group
2, group 12 and group 18) or a half filled subshell (e.g. group 7 and group 15), which are
generally stable, will require more energy and thus the ionization energy will be higher
than is expected from the common trend.
For example, in the second period neon with a completely filled shell has the highest first
ionization energy. Beryllium with a complete _s_ subshell shows the first ionization energy
greater than expected and it even exceeds the I 1 of boron. Similarly, nitrogen with an
exactly half filled _p_ subshell shows an I 1 higher than what the common trend predicts.

**1.6.3Electron gain energy**
The energy change that occurs when an electron is added to a gaseous atom is called the
**electron gain energy.** For most atoms, energy is released when an electron is added.

For example, electron gain energy for the chlorine atom shown in the process below is
-349 kJ mol-1. The negative sign indicates that energy is released during the process.

```
Cl(g) + e Cl-(g)  EEG = -349 kJ mol-1
```
( _EEG_ = Electron gain energy)

However, there are few atoms with positive electron gain energy. E.g.: Be, N. This is
because they possess relatively stable configuration Be ( _s_^2 ) and N ( _p_^3 ) and as a result
adding of an electron would be somewhat difficult with electron – electron repulsion is
the dominating factor.

```
N(g) + e N-(g)  EEG = +134 kJ mol-1
Be(g) + e Be-(g)  EEG = +231 kJ mol-1
```
The electron gain energy become less positive across a period and more positive down a
group.

As accepted internationally,  EEG is used as a quantitative physical quantity to measure
the attraction of an electron by an atom and related to electron affinity as follows.
```
```
Electron gain energy ( EEG ) =- Electron affinity ( E A)
```
```
Thus the electron affinity of an atom can be closely related to  EEG and defined as the
change in energy when the anion of the element loses an electron in the gaseous phase
(A-(g) A(g)+ e;  E = E A which is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to
 EEG ) become more positive across a period and less positive down a group.
```
```
1.6.4Electronegativity
It is defined as the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself. The greater
an atom’s electronegativity, the greater its ability to attract electrons.
```
```
The American chemist Linus Pauling (1901–1994) developed the first and most widely
used electronegativity scale, which is known as the Pauling scale. Generally there is an
increase in electronegativity from left to right across a period in the periodic table. With
some exceptions (especially in the transition metals), electronegativity decreases with
increasing atomic number in a group. Noble gases too have very small but non zero
electronegativity according to the Pauling scale. In molecules, the difference between
electronegativities of two atoms forming a bond will determine the ionic or covalent
nature of the bond.

**Introduction**
Chemical bonds and structure of molecules are conceptualmodels based on themodern
atomic model, in order to explain the physical and chemical properties of matter.

Many atoms do not have stable outermost valance shell configurations, therefore
chemical bonds occur between atoms in order to achieve stability. The following table
(Figure 2.1) explains how valence electrons participate in different types of chemical
bonding using several acceptable models.

```
Figure 2.1 Types of chemical bonds
```
**2.1Covalent bonds**
Covalent bonds are formed when a pair of electrons is shared between two atoms of the
same element or different elements. The sharing pair of electrons contribute one electron
from each atom to form the electron pair. Consequently, stable electron configurations
are often achieved by both atoms in respect to the total number of electrons in the valence
shells.

Kossel, Langmuir and Lewis stated that the filling of electrons into a valance shell up to
the maximum value of 8 results a stable electron configuration, hence called ‘octet’ rule.

According to the current knowledge of electron configurations, the maximum number of
valance electrons in 2 _s_ and 2 _p_ orbitals of elements in the second period (n=2) is 8.

chemical bonds occur between atoms in order to achieve stability. The following table

```
Therefore, elements in the second period complete the octet when forming chemical
bonds thereby achieving a greater stability. This is more likely for elements such as C, N,
O and F which form chemical bonds to complete the octet.
```
```
The valance shell of elements in the third period (n=3) and subsequent periods consist of
d sub energy level in addition to s and p sub energy levels. Therefore, when forming
chemical bonds, there could be instances where the number of electrons in the valance
shell	may	exceed	eight.	Examples	of	such	molecules	are	SO 2 and SO 3. In such molecules
the number of electrons in the valance shell of sulphur is greater than eight. The presence
of d orbitals in the valence shell of the sulphur atom permits 18 electrons. Since, the d
orbitals in the valance shell also participate in bonding, the number of valance electrons
in	the	sulphur	atom	can	exceed	the	octet.	However,	for	such	atoms,	it	is	not	always	
necessary for the d 	orbitals	to	participate	in	bonding.	For	example,	in	the	H 2 S molecule,
the sulphur atom complete the octet without involving d orbitals.
```
```
There are other situations where atoms of some elements do not necessarily complete the
octet.	Elements	like	Be,	B	and	Al	form	some	electron	deficient	compounds	such	as	BeCl 2 ,
BH 3 , BCl 3 and AlCl 3 	are	examples	of	such	compounds	with	an	incomplete	valance	shell.	
In the case of hydrogen atom where only 1 s orbital is present, the stable electron
configuration is achieved when the valance shell consists of two electrons. In all instances
described above, the number of electrons in the valance shell after forming chemical
bonds is an even number. However, this is not always true, as there are compounds such
as NO and NO 2 each having an odd number of electrons even without completing the
octet.
```
```
In order to understand the arrangement of bond pairs and lone pairs in molecules and ions,
a“model” was introduced by Gilbert Lewis known as “Lewis dot structure”.
```
```
2.1.1Lewis dot diagrams and Lewis dot-dash structures
The Lewis dot diagram is used to illustrate the atomic skeleton, nature of the bonding
present (single, double and triple bond) and the distribution of the valance shell electrons
around each atom of the given chemical formula. In Lewis dot-dash structure, a bonding
electron pair is denoted by a short line drawn between the two atoms.
Chemical formula → Lewis dot diagram →Lewis dot-dash structure
Cl 2
```
```
The following factors need to be considered when drawing Lewis dot diagrams:
 Elements	H	and	F	are	generally	not	considered	as	the	central	atom	since	these	can
form only single bonds. Atoms which are capable of forming multiple bonds are
placed as the central atom.
 The element with the lower electronegativity is generally the central atom.
```

```
G.C.E. (A/L) CHEMISTRY: UNIT 2 Structure and Bonding
```
It is important to consider the following facts for molecules and ions with one central
atom.
(i) Identification of the central atom and surrounding atoms.
(ii) Calculating the total number of electrons for a given chemical formula
considering all electrons in the valence shell of each atom.
e.g.: In H 2 O,	oxygen	atom	contributes	6	electrons	and	one	electron	from	each
hydrogen atom (two electrons from two hydrogen atoms), which sum up to 8 when
considering the total electron count (6 + 2 = 8) of the valence shells.

```
If it is a negatively charged ion, then negative charges should be counted as well.
e.g.: In the OH- ion, contribution	of	electrons	from	oxygen	atom	is	six	and
hydrogen atom one together with one electron due to negative charge of the ion
adding up to eight as the total number of electrons (6 + 1 + 1 = 8).
```
```
If the ion is positively charged, then an equivalent number is deducted from the
total valance electron count.
e.g.: In NH 4 + ion, N atom contributes 5 valance electrons and four hydrogen atoms
contribute 4 electrons. However, since it is a cation, then one electron (equivalent
to number of positive charges) is deducted resulting 8 electrons in the valance
shell of nitrogen atom (5 + 4 – 1 = 8).
(iii) A bond is denoted by a pair of dots between the central atom and a surrounding
atom.	Each	surrounding	atom	is	connected	to	the	central	atom	with	at	least	one
bond.
(iv) Bonding electron pairs are denoted first as a pair of dots (Lewis dot diagram) or a
short line (Lewis dot-dash diagram) drawn between central atom and each of
surrounding	atoms.	Next,	the	remaining	electrons	are	distributed,	starting	from	the
most	electronegative	atom,	to	complete	the	octet.	Each	electron	pair	is	marked	by
pair of dots (lone pair electrons). If the electronegative atoms are surrounding
atom, then lone pairs are marked on these surrounding atoms in order to complete
the octet of each atom. CCl 4 	is	an	example	for	this.
```
```

electrons is marked on the nitrogen atom.

atom, then lone pairs are marked on these surrounding atoms in order to complete
the octet of each atom. CCl 4 	is	an	example	for	this.

(vi) After distributing all the electron pairs, the number of electrons on each atom
should be compared with the number of electrons in the non-bonded state of the
atom (free atom) to assign the formal charge and then check completion of the
octet. In the case of a bond, one electron is counted for each atom and if lone pairs

Valance electrons from C atom = 4 _e_
Valance electrons from O atom = 6 _e_

After marking the bonding electron pair, the number of remaining electrons is eight.
After distributing the electron pairs around the more	electronegative	oxygen	atom	
completing octet, another pair is left. This lone pair of electrons is marked on the
carbon atom.

The initial electron distribution is illustrated below. However, the octet is not completed for
the	carbon	atom.	Therefore,	rearrangement	of	a	lone	pair	of	electrons	on	the	oxygen	atom	as	
shown by curved arrows in (e) and (f) is done in order to complete the octet on the C atom

2.2 Dative covalent bonds
In a molecule or ion, dative bonds are formed when atoms with empty orbitals interact
with atoms with a lone pair of electrons. In certain cases when the free atom of the element
has less than four valance electrons (as in Be, B), the number of covalent bonds that the
particular atom can form is less than four. This results in incomplete octet with lower
stability. Therefore, such electron deficient central atoms preferably react with the atom
having lone pairs which can donate an electron pair to the central atom to complete the
octet. The reaction of BH 3 with CO to produce borane carbonyl and the reaction with CN-
to produce cyanoborohydride are	example with such dative bonds. Furthermore, reaction
of NH 3 with BF 3 to form a dative covalent bond between B and N	is	another	example.	
The dative bond is formed when the empty orbitals in B overlaps with the orbital having
the lone pair in the nitrogen atom. In this case a central atom cannot be chosen precisely.
Since the lone pair on the nitrogen atom is donating the electron pair to B, the bond can
be denoted by an arrow. The arrow head is pointed to the electron deficient atom. This
can be illustrated using formal charges as well as shown below.
```
```
Figure 2.6 Dative covalent bond (H 3 N-BF 3 )
```
```
Dative covalent bonds are also formed when metal ions or some metal atoms react with
molecules or ions having lone pairs (H 2 O, NH 3 , CO molecules and CN- ions) in order to
form	complexes.	The	following	illustrates	the	formation	of	a	complex	ion	when	Cu2+ is

**2.3 Valance Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory (VSEPR theory)
Ronald Gillespie** and **Ronald Sydney Nyholm** suggested that electron pairs surrounding
the central atoms of a given molecule or ion are arranged	in	a	way	to	keep	maximum
spatial distance	apart	from	each	other.		Gillespie	has	explained the shapes of molecules
when the central atom is a main group element while Nyholm discussed the shapes of
molecules with transition elements as the central atom. By 1963, Gillespie introduced
VSEPR theory for finding shape of molecules or ions.

There are mainly two kinds of electron pairs surrounding the central atom. The first type
is the bonding electron pair which is held between two nuclei, by attractive forces. The
second type is electron pairs not participating in the bonding known as lone pairs. Since
lone pair of electrons are under the influence of a single nucleus, the electron cloud
occupies a relatively larger spatial volume. Both bonding and lone pairs of electrons of
an atom act as repulsive unit to keep further away from each other. If multiple bonds
(double or triple bonds) are present between atoms, each multiple bond is considered as
a single repulsive unit.

There are three different types of bonding when the number of covalent bonds formed
between the central atom and a surrounding atom is considered. These are single bonds,
double bonds and triple bonds where double and triple bonds represent multiple bonds.
For example, in the CO 2 molecule, double bonds are present between the central carbon
atom and the surrounding	oxygen	atoms. In the HCN molecule a triple bond is present
between	the	central	C	atom	and	N	atom	as	shown	below.	Each	single,	double, triple bond
or lone pair is considered as one repulsive unit or a	VSEPR	unit.

The three pairs of electrons in the triple bond of HCN molecule is considered as a single
repulsive unit. This is because the three electron pairs are located between C and N atoms
preventing independent movement of three electron pairs from each other, thus the triple
bond can be considered as a single repulsive unit or single VSEPR	unit.

The number of repulsive units surrounding the central atom can be clearly identified using
the Lewis structure. Table 2.2 gives few	examples	on	how	to	identify the number of
electron	pairs	surrounding	the	central	atom	and	the	VSEPR	units	around	the	central	atom.

According to the VSEPR theory, molecules/ ions achieve stability by maintaining a
maximum distance between repulsion units, to get the minimum repulsion force between
them.
```
```
A lone pair of electrons occupies greater spatial distribution (spatial volume) compared
to a bonding electron pair. Hence, it is considered that the repulsion between two lone
pairs of electrons (lone pair ↔ lone pair) is higher than the repulsion between two pairs
of bonding electrons (bonding pair ↔ bonding pair). This results in intermediate repulsive
force for interaction between lone pair and bonding pair (lone pair ↔ bonding pair) of
electrons.

**Trigonal bipyramidal electron pair geometry**
Here	there	are	five	VSEPR	units/ repulsive units around the central atom. These are
arranged in four different types when bonding and lone pairs are considered.

atom of the SCl 4 molecule as shown below.

Therefore, it is called a ‘T’ shape molecule. Here, two lone pairs and one I–Cl

following Figure 2.15 illustrates the octahedral electron pair geometry of such molecules
having three possible shapes. Four repulsive units are in one plane while remaining two
units lie perpendicular to this plane.

First consider the situation where all the repulsive units are bonding (e.g. : SF 6 ). When the
substituted atoms surrounding the center are connected with imaginary dotted lines, an
octahedron with eight planes is created. Therefore, shape of such molecules are called
‘octahedral’.

Next,	consider	the	molecules	with	five	repulsive	units	in	the	form	of	bonding	pairs	and	
one repulsive unit in the form of lone pair of electrons (XeOF 4 ). The electron pair
geometry of XeOF 4 is octahedral. When the surrounding atoms of XeOF 4 are connected
with imaginary lines pyramid, with a square shaped base is created. Therefore the
theoretical shape is ‘square pyramidal’. The repulsion between the lone pair on the Xe
atom and Xe - F bond has changed the regular shape of the molecule. Therefore the shape
of XeOF 4 is called distorted square pyramidal.
**Figure 2.17** Electron	pair	geometry	of	XeOF 4
When a molecule consists of four repulsive units in the form of bonding electron pairs
and two repulsive units in the form of lone pairs, then the shape is called ‘square planar’
as illustrated by the XeF 4 molecule.

**2.3.1 Hybridization of atomic orbitals**
The conceptual model of hybridization can be explained qualitatively using a carbon
atom. The valance shell of carbon atom in the ground state consists of one electron pair
and two unpaired electrons (2 _s_^2 2 _p_^2 ). However, in order to form four covalent bonds, the
presence of four orbitals with an unpaired electron in each is necessary. Therefore,
electrons in the ground state rearrange to form an excited state with four unpaired
electrons.

```

```
Here, one of the 2 _s_ electrons in the valance shell of carbon atom absorbs energy and gets
promoted to an empty 2 _p_ orbital as shown in Figure 2.19. This transition is feasible as the
energy gap between 2 _s_ and 2 _p_ orbitals is relatively low. Now the atom is in the excited
state with unpaired electrons in 2 _s_ and 2 _p_ energy levels as illustrated above. Though there
are four unpaired electrons available for bonding, these electrons are in two different

energy levels and in two different shapes of atomic orbitals (spherical s orbital and
dumbbell shaped p orbitals). At this state, if C atom for ms 4 bonds with 4 H atoms to
form CH 4 , the type of bonding consists of one C-H bond formed between 2s orbital of
carbon with the s orbital of the hydrogen and three C-H bonds formed with overlap of 2 p
orbitals from carbon and s orbitals from hydrogen. Then the CH 4 molecule	is	expected	to	
have two different types of bonds with different bond angles.
```
```
However, all four C-H bonds and bond angle in CH 4 are identical. Therefore, a valid
assumption	is	mixing	of	these	2 s a nd 2 p orbitals to form four atomic orbitals with same
energy and same shape when forming the C-H bonds. This concept is called
‘ hybridization ’. It is not possible to depict a valid structure for the CH 4 molecule without
the concept of hybridization, for the formation of identical four C-H bonds by 2 s and 2 p
orbitals of the C atom, if considered separately. It	is	also	not	possible	to	explain	the	bond	
angle of HCH as 109.5o.
```
```
The following facts are important for understanding the model of hybridization of atomic
orbitals.
(i) The concept of hybridization cannot be used for an atom alone, but it is used to
describe the bonding formed by a particular atom in a molecule.
(ii) There should be a minimum of two atomic orbitals with different shapes and
energy	mixed	to	form	hybrid	orbitals.	
e.g. : A s orbital can hybridize with one or more of p orbitals (up to 3) of the
same atom. These hybrid orbitals do not have clear identity; hence, has a
shape different from original orbitals.
(iii) The number of hybrid orbitals formed is equal to the number of atomic orbitals
that participate in the hybridization. Though atomic orbitals at different energy
levels	are	mixed,	the	resulting	hybrid	orbitals	will	be	at	the	same	energy	level.	
These hybrid orbitals differ only in the orientation in 3D space but are identical
in shape and energy when the atomic orbitals are s and p.
(iv) A hybrid orbital in a particular atom can overlap (linear overlap) with a hybrid
orbital or un-hybridized atomic orbital of another atom to form bonds.
```
```
Note that hybridization is not a true physical process and is an imaginary process
presented as a concept. According to this imaginary process, there are three different
kinds of hybridizations possible with a carbon	atom	in	the	excited	state. A summary is
given below.
(i) Mixing	of	the	 s orbital with three p orbitals to form four sp^3 hybridized
orbitals. ( tetrahedral geometry)
(ii) Mixing	of	the	 s orbital with two p orbitals to form three sp^2 hybridized
orbitals. ( trigonal planar geometry)
(iii) Mixing	of	the	 s orbital with one p orbital to form two sp hybridized orbitals.

2.3.2 Formation of double and triple bonds**
If there are two bonds between two atoms, one bond is called a ‘σ bond’ while the other
bond is called a‘π bond’. Consider the formation of a double bond between two carbon
atoms in the ethene molecule (CH 2 CH 2 ). Linear overlap of two hybridized orbitals form
a σ bond and the π bond is formed with lateral overlap of the unhybridized _p_ orbitals in
each carbon atom.
**Figure 2.2 2** _sp_^2 hybridized orbitals and _p_ orbital orientation in C 2 H 4
Since the axes	of	two	 _p_ orbitals are parallel to each other, _lateral overlap_ is observed
between these dumbbell shaped _p_ orbitals. If the axes	of	 _p_ orbitals are not parallel to each
other, there is less chance for these orbitals to overlap. In the above diagram, the axes	of	
two hybrid orbitals are aligned on a straight line, thus the overlap between these orbitals
is considered a _linear overlap_.

triple bonds are formed. This triple bond consists of one σ bond and two π bonds between
two carbon atoms. The Lewis structure of ethyne is shown below.

atoms have _sp_ hybridization	and	the	axes	of	the	remaining	two	 _p_ orbitals of two carbon
atoms lie parallel to each other. It is clearly illustrated in the Figure 2.25.

2.3.3 Resonance structures
It is possible to draw a number of Lewis structures for a certain molecule or ion. These
Lewis structures with the same skeleton or atom positions are called ‘ Resonance
structures ’. The reason is when there are multiple bondings present (double or triple
bonds), the position of the π bond and lone pair of electrons could be changed without
changing the atomic arrangement (skeleton of the molecule). The following Figure 2.26
are the two resonance structures for NO 2 − ion, in which the position of π bond has been
changed without changing the atomic arrangement.
```
```
(a) (b)
Figure 2.26 Resonance structures of the NO 2 −ion
```
```
In NO 2 − ion, two resonance structures can be drawn changing the position of the negative
charge and the π bond. In this case, both structures (a) and (b) are identical and cannot be
distinguished	from	each	other.		Figure	2.27	clearly	explains	how	one	resonance	structure	
can be converted to the other using curved arrows. In general, to mark the movement of
a lone pair of electrons or π bonding electrons, a curved arrow is used. The arrow head is
pointed to the place where electrons have moved. The diagram given below shows the
formation of resonance structure in NO 2 − ion.

Characteristics of resonance
(i) Resonance	structures	(contributing	structures)	do	not	have	real	existence.	They
are imaginary structures drawn for convenience of understanding the nature of
molecules or ions. It is assumed that the concept/ model of resonance hybrid
represents	real	existence	of	molecule	or	ion.
(ii) Resonance for equal resonance structures, the bond lengths in the resonating
unit becomes equal (e.g.: NO 2 −, where both N – O bond lengths are equal).
```

```
G.C.E. (A/L) CHEMISTRY: UNIT 2 Structure and Bonding
```
```
(iii) The resonance hybrid has comparatively lower energy and thus a greater
stability than any of the contributing structures.
(iv) Equivalent resonance structures make equal contribution to the resonance
hybrid.
(v) Non–equivalent resonance structures make unequal contribution to the
resonance hybrid, whereas most stable resonance structures make major
contribution.
```
**Formal Charges**
Formal charge is the hypothetical charge on an atom in a molecule or polyatomic ion.
This concept is used to identify the energetically most stable Lewis structure. In general,
it is considered that the formal charge on each of the atom is zero or close to zero, when
the Lewis structure is stable.

The following steps help to evaluate the formal charge (FC).
(i)

```
(ii) In a Lewis formula, an atom that has the same number of bonds as its number of
valence electrons in the atom, its formal charge is zero.
(iii) Add formal charges of all the atoms to find the total value.
(a) In a molecule, the sum of the formal charges is zero.
(b) In a polyatomic ion, the sum of the formal charges is equal to the net charge
of the ion.
e.g.:
```
In NH 3 the N atom has three bonds and two unshared electrons (which are not involved
in bond formation).

For N atom of NH 3

= 5 – (3+2) = 0
Formal charge of N atom in ammonia is zero.

In NH 3 the N atom has three bonds and two unshared electrons (which are not involved
in bond formation).

For N atom of NH 3

= 5 – (3+2) = 0
Formal charge of N atom in ammonia is zero.

```
```
G.C.E. (A/L) CHEMISTRY: UNIT 2 Structure and Bonding
```
```
For H atom of NH 3
```
```
= 1 – (1+0) = 0
Formal charge of H atom of ammonia is zero.
```
```
The formal charges of N and H are both zero in NH 3 , so the sum of the formal charges of
the molecules is zero.
```
```
In NH 4 + the N atom has 4 bonds and no unshared electrons is on the N atom. Hence, formal
charge on the N atom of NH 4 +ion is +1 and formal charge on each H atom is zero. Total
of formal charges of NH 4 + ion is equal to +1 and it is the charge of ammonium ion.
```
```
(i) The most likely Lewis structure for a molecule or ion is the one in which the
formal charge on each atom is zero or closer to zero as possible.
(ii) Negative formal charges are more likely to occur on more electronegative
elements.
(iii) Lewis structure in which adjacent atoms have formal charges of the same sign
are not stable, hence not an accurate representations.
Following examples assign formal charges to the atoms in nitrosyl chloride, NOCl. The
Cl atom and the O atom are both bonded to the N atom. Two Lewis formulae that satisfy
the octet rule whereas formal charges are not same.
```
```
(a) (b)
```
```
For Cl, FC = 7 – (2 + 4) = +1 For Cl, FC = 7 – (1 + 6) = 0
For N, FC = 5 – (3 + 2) = 0 For N, FC = 5 – (3 + 2) = 0
For O, FC = 6 – (1 + 6) = -1 For O, FC = 6 – (2 + 4) = 0
```
```
These two structures have satisfied the octet rule. But the Lewis structure (b) is
energetically more stable since the formal charge on each atom is zero.
```
```
Although the structure (a) is drawn with a double bond between N and Cl atoms to explain
the concept of charge distribution. Keep in mind that drawing multiple covalent bonds
should be limited to only between C, N, O, S and P and halogens (Cl, Br, I) and oxygen
(O), when drawing Lewis dot-dash structures/ resonance structures.

**Rules to estimate relative stability of resonance structures**
(i) The most stable resonance structure has the least formal charge separation. Thus
it contains the greater number of covalent bonds and it contributes mostly to the
resonance	hybrid.	Both	maximizing	the	number	of	bonds	and	satisfying	the	octet
rule should be achieved.
(ii) Structures in which adjacent atoms have formal charges of the same sign tend
to be unstable.
(iii) When opposite formal charges are placed on adjacent atoms, positive charge
should fall on electropositive atom and negative charge on electronegative atom.
(iv) When positive formal charges placed on highly electronegative atoms such as F
and O, the structures are unstable.

Formation of resonance structures of nitrate ion (NO 3 −) is given in Figure 2.28.

```

All the resonance structures are equivalent. Hence their stabilities are equal. Hence, they
contribute equally for the resonance hybrid.

The resonance structures of N 2 O are as follows. These resonance structures have satisfied
the octet rule.

Resonance structures of the carbonate ion can be used to describe the structure of the
resonance hybrid. When resonance structures of the carbonate ion are considered, there
are	at	least	two	lone	pairs	of	electrons	present	on	each	oxygen	atom.	However	the	third	
lone pair may or may not be present on oxygen atoms as position of π bond is changed
when forming the resonance structures. Since the position of the π electron cloud is
changed, then the electron cloud is delocalized among all three C-O bonds. The resonance
hybrid can be represented by Figure 2.32. Note that delocalized electron cloud on C-O
bonds is denoted by dotted lines. Bond lengths of CO 3 2− are the same since actual structure
is the combination of all features of the three resonance structures (resonance hybrid).

2.3.4 Effect of electronegativity and geometry on the polarity of molecules
If the electronegativity difference between the atoms forming a chemical bond is large,
then electron cloud can be considered to be polarized. The electrons in this polarized
covalent bond have higher probability of being found closer to the more electronegative
atom.	Electronegativity	difference	plays	a	vital	role	in	determining	the	polarity	of	a	bond.	
Therefore, the higher the electronegativity difference, the higher is the polarity. However,
when considering polarity of the entire molecule, then the geometry of the molecule is
also	important;	for	example,	though	C=O	bond	is	polar,	CO 2 molecule is non-polar. The
reason is the total symmetric linear geometry of the CO 2 molecule. Similarly, C-Cl bond
is polar but, CCl 4 molecule is non-polar due to the total symmetric tetrahedral shape of
the molecule. Diatomic molecules of same element (e.g.: Cl 2 , O 2 , N 2 	etc.)	are	examples	
for	nonpolar	simple	molecules.	Bonds	of	those	molecules	are	examples	for	the	totally	
nonpolar covalent bonds.

2.3.5 Dipole moment
This concept can be clearly understood by taking a molecule with one single bond such
as HCl. In a polar molecule, negative pole is created on one end of the molecule, and the
positive pole is created on the opposite end of the molecule. Accordingly, in HCl
molecule, negative pole is on the Cl atom and the positive pole is created on the H atom.
Following is the way of representing such polar bonds.
```
```
Dipole is notated as ‘ ’ and the arrow head is pointed towards the negative pole of
the molecule.
δ+H Clδ-
```
```
e.g.:
```
```
If there is a permanent dipole present in a molecule, then the magnitude of polarization
on each pole of dipole is equal, resulting in an electrically neutral molecule. Dipole
moment is calculated by multiplying the magnitude of a polarity by the distance between
the two atoms. When considering HCl molecule, due to asymmetric distribution of the

```
```
Magnitude of dipole moment( μ )= charge of the pole ( δ )× bond length( r )
```
electron cloud, one of the poles is located on the H atom and the other pole is on the Cl
atom. The dipole moment of the HCl molecule can be calculated as follows:

In the above equation units of _δ_ is Coulombs (C) and _r_ is meters (m). Therefore the unit
of dipole moment is C m.

Dipole moments (vector quantity- it has a magnitude and direction) of molecules are
usually	expressed	in	Debye	(D),	a	unit	equal	to	3.34 × 10−30 C m.
Since the electronegativity of an atom describes the ability to pull electrons towards itself,
models are available to estimate the percentage of ionic nature in a chemical bond using
the electronegativity difference. Information on dipole moment and bond length can also
be used to calculate percentage ionic character. However, it should be supported by
experimental	details.	Hence	the	bond	between	atoms	of	two	different	elements	is	not	
purely covalent. It has certain percentage of ionic characteristics.

**2.3.6 Factors affecting the magnitude of electronegativity**
The electronegativity of an element varies slightly depending on the environment of the
element, although it is invariably assumed to be a constant. Given below are four
important factors that influence the electronegativity.
 **Hybridization**
Higher the _s_ character, greater the electronegativity.
Electronegativity	of	C:	C( _sp_^3 ) < C( _sp_^2 ) < C( _sp_ )
Hence, the electronegativity of carbon atoms in CH 4 , C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 2 increases in
the given order CH 4 < C 2 H 4 < C 2 H2.
 **Charge**
e.g.: electronegativity of N: NH 2 −<NH 3 <NH 4 +
All nitrogen atoms are _sp_^3 hybridized, electronegativity N−<N<N+; Higher
the positive charge on the atom, greater the electronegativity when compared to
the neutral atom which in turn has a higher electronegativity than an atom with a
negative charge.
 **Oxidation number**
The hybridization of sulphur atom in H 2 S, SO 3 2− and SO 4 2− species is _sp_^3 and the
charge on sulphur atom is zero. The hybridization and the charge of the given
three molecules are same. Therefore electronegativity of sulphur in the given
species	are	determined	by	oxidation	number	of	the	sulphur	atom	in	each	species.
The	oxidation	numbers	on	the	sulphur	atom	of	H 2 S, SO 3 2− and SO 4 2− are -2, +4 and
+6 respectively. The higher the positive charge, greater the electronegativity when
compared to the neutral atom. Therefore the electronegativity of sulphur in
H 2 S<SO 3 2−<SO 4 2−

Magnitude of dipole moment( μ )= charge of the pole ( δ )× bond length( r )
```
electron cloud, one of the poles is located on the H atom and the other pole is on the Cl
atom. The dipole moment of the HCl molecule can be calculated as follows:

In the above equation units of _δ_ is Coulombs (C) and _r_ is meters (m). Therefore the unit
of dipole moment is C m.

Dipole moments (vector quantity- it has a magnitude and direction) of molecules are
usually	expressed	in	Debye	(D),	a	unit	equal	to	3.34 × 10−30 C m.
Since the electronegativity of an atom describes the ability to pull electrons towards itself,
models are available to estimate the percentage of ionic nature in a chemical bond using
the electronegativity difference. Information on dipole moment and bond length can also
be used to calculate percentage ionic character. However, it should be supported by
experimental	details.	Hence	the	bond	between	atoms	of	two	different	elements	is	not	
purely covalent. It has certain percentage of ionic characteristics.

**2.3.6 Factors affecting the magnitude of electronegativity**
The electronegativity of an element varies slightly depending on the environment of the
element, although it is invariably assumed to be a constant. Given below are four
important factors that influence the electronegativity.
 **Hybridization**
Higher the _s_ character, greater the electronegativity.
Electronegativity	of	C:	C( _sp_^3 ) < C( _sp_^2 ) < C( _sp_ )
Hence, the electronegativity of carbon atoms in CH 4 , C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 2 increases in
the given order CH 4 < C 2 H 4 < C 2 H2.
 **Charge**
e.g.: electronegativity of N: NH 2 −<NH 3 <NH 4 +
All nitrogen atoms are _sp_^3 hybridized, electronegativity N−<N<N+; Higher
the positive charge on the atom, greater the electronegativity when compared to
the neutral atom which in turn has a higher electronegativity than an atom with a
negative charge.
 **Oxidation number**
The hybridization of sulphur atom in H 2 S, SO 3 2− and SO 4 2− species is _sp_^3 and the
charge on sulphur atom is zero. The hybridization and the charge of the given
three molecules are same. Therefore electronegativity of sulphur in the given
species	are	determined	by	oxidation	number	of	the	sulphur	atom	in	each	species.
The	oxidation	numbers	on	the	sulphur	atom	of	H 2 S, SO 3 2− and SO 4 2− are -2, +4 and
+6 respectively. The higher the positive charge, greater the electronegativity when
compared to the neutral atom. Therefore the electronegativity of sulphur in
H 2 S<SO 3 2−<SO 4 2−

```
G.C.E. (A/L) CHEMISTRY: UNIT 2 Structure and Bonding
```
```
 Nature of the other atoms to which the atom of interest is attached in the
molecule
e.g.:	 Electronegativity	 of	 C	 in	 CF 4 is greater than that of CCl 4. Higher
electronegativity of fluorine makes the carbon atom is attached to four fluorine
atoms highly positive compared to the carbon atom attached to four chlorine
atoms. This makes the carbon attached to fluorine to have a higher
electronegativity.
```
```
In applying the above rules, when an atom of same element in different molecules, priority
is always given for hybridization over the charge of the atom. If the hybridization is same,
then	the	priority	is	given	based	on	the	charge	of	the	atom.	For	an	example,	hybridization	
of nitrogen in NH 3 and NH 4 + are the same. Hence, electronegativity of nitrogen atoms in
these two forms is determined by the charge. Nitrogen atom of NH 3 is neutral and
nitrogen atom of NH 4 + is positive and hence nitrogen atom of NH 4 + is more
electronegative.
```
```
Likewise,	if	the	hybridization	and	the	charge	are	same,	then	the	oxidation	number	can	be	
considered.	For	an	example,	hybridization	and	charge	in	CH 3 F and CH 4 are the same. The
oxidation	 number	 of	 carbon	 in	 CH 3 F is -2 and in CH 4 is -4. Therefore, the
electronegativity	can	be	determined	based	on	the	oxidation	number	of	carbon	atoms.	The	
electronegativity of carbon in CH 3 F	which	has	higher	oxidation	number	is	higher	than	
that of CH 4.
```
```
The effect of the other atoms to be considered when the hybridization, charge and
oxidation	number	are	same.	For	an	example,	electronegativity	of	carbon	atom	in	CHCl 3
and CHF 3 can be compared with respect to the electronegativity of the atoms attached to
the carbon atom. Hence, carbon atom of CHF 3 , is more negative than that of CHCl 3.
```
```
2.4 Ionic bonds/ ionic interactions
Ionic bonds are created due to electrostatic attractive forces between positive and negative
ions. These positive and negative ions are packed in a certain pattern called ‘lattice
structure’ in solid (crystalline) state. Here, each positive ion is surrounded by negatively
charged ions and vice versa. In NaCl lattice, each Na+	ion	is	surrounded	by	six	Cl- ions
and each Cl-	ion	is	surrounded	by	six	Na+ ions.

Figure 2.38 Lattice structure of NaCl
```
The cation is the smaller ion in an ionic lattice and its electron cloud is strongly bound to
the nucleus. The anion is the large ion in an ionic lattice and hence has more loosely held
outermost electrons compared to the cation. The shape of the electron cloud of an anion
can easily be changed as a result of an external electric field. Large anions are more
susceptible to a change in the shape of the electron cloud under the influence of an
electrostatic attraction of cation. The field strength of a cation can pull the electron cloud
of an anion. The ability of a cation to pull the electron cloud of an anion is called
**polarizing power**. When a cation moves towards an anion, the tendency of the electron
cloud of an anion to change its spherical shape, as a result of the positive field strength of
the cation, is called **polarizability**.

Cation has a strong polarizing power, if it is small and highly charged.

(polarizing power of the cation and polarizability of the anion).

Polarization is increased by:
 High charge and small size of the cation
 High charge and large size of the anion

Ionic characters decreases as polarization increases.
Covalent character increases.

**2.5 Metallic bonds**
In	general,	small	molecules	with	simple	covalent	bonding	exhibit	relatively low melting
points compared to ionic compounds. Ionic solids do not conduct electricity in the solid
state but are capable of conducting electricity in the liquid (molten) state due to the
mobility of ions. The melting point of different metals can be observed in a wide range
and	metals	are	excellent	conductors	of	electricity and heat regardless of liquid or solid
state.	For	example,	melting	point	of	mercury	(Hg)	is	as	low	as	-39 °C while tungsten (W)
melts at 3410 ºC. Also, in nuclear reactions, liquid sodium is used as a coolant due to its
heat transfer capacity. These differences in metals compared to ionic and covalent
compounds cannot be	explained	using	models	of	covalent	or	ionic	bonding.	

The model for metallic bonding was proposed by Paul Karl Ludwig Drude and Hendrik
Lorentz based on the kinetic model on the behaviour of gases. According to this model,
metal atoms are converted to positive ions donating electrons in the valance shell to form
the metallic bond. Therefore, a massive electron cloud is created by valance electrons
released by large number of atoms. This electron cloud is capable of overcoming repulsive
forces among positively charged metal ions keeping them in a lattice. The entire
arrangement of lattice structure in massive electron cloud including the electrostatic force
between the electron cloud and positively charged metal ions (cations) is considered as
metallic bond. In order to stabilize this lattice of positively charged metal ions and
electrons are constantly moving in the lattice structure. The strength of a metallic bond is
primarily dependent on three main factors.
 **Number of electrons donated by atoms to create the metallic bond**
For	example,	sodium	atom	can	donate	one	electron	as	it has one electron in the
valance shell while, magnesium atom donates two electrons to the metallic bond.
When the number of electrons donated by an atoms increases, the strength of the
metallic bond is enhanced as well.

 Ionic radius
When the radii of the cations increase, the density of the electron clouds decrease
resulting in poor metallic bonds.
 Ionic nature
This	means	the	extent	to	which	valance	shell	electrons	are	contributing towards
the	metallic	bond.	For	example,	sodium completely releases the electron on the
valance shell to form the metallic bond. However, with increasing ionization
energy, there is a less probability to release these electrons to form the metallic
bond. This factor has almost no influence on alkaline metals and alkaline earth
metals, but it is important when transition metal elements are considered.
```
```
2.6 Secondary interactions
All	types	of	intermolecular	interactions	exist	among	molecules	are	known	as	secondary	
interactions. They are commonly referred as van der Waals interactions. Those
interactions can be categorized into five types.
 Ion - dipole interactions
 Dipole - dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding
 Ion - induced dipole interactions
 Dipole - induced dipole interactions
 Dispersion interactions (London forces)
```
```
Van der Waals forces are the attractive or repulsive forces between molecular entities or
between groups within the same molecular entity. It includes dipole – dipole interaction,
dipole – induced dipole interactions and London forces.
```
```
Ion – dipole interactions
Ionic salts such as NaCl are soluble in water due to secondary interactions between
positive ions and negative^ ions with water molecules. The cation in an ionic compound
(e.g.: Na+ in NaCl) interacts with a negatively polarized atom (δ-) in a molecule (O in
water) and vice versa to establish ion-dipole interactions. Therefore, in an aqueous
solution of NaCl, cations (Na+) and anions (Cl-) are surrounded by water molecules to
achieve stability in an aqueous medium through these ion-dipole interactions.

```
**Dipole – dipole interactions**
Interactions among molecules with a permanent dipole moment are called **dipole – dipole
interactions**. It is clearly illustrated as a model by Figure 2.40. The strength of these
attractive forces are generally ranged between 0.5 – 15 kJ mol-1.

```
Figure 2.40 Dipole – dipole interactions
```
Attractive forces between two opposite poles (δ+ and δ-) of polar molecule can be more
specifically called dipole–dipole interactions. Interactions between two formaldehyde
molecules can be taken as	an	example	for dipole – dipole interactions.

```
Figure 2. 41 Dipole – dipole interactions in formaldehyde
```
**Hydrogen bonding**
This is a type of dipole-dipole interactions, some of hydrogen bonds are stronger than the
other kinds of dipole–dipole interactions (0.5 – 15 kJ mol-1). In general, the strength of
hydrogen bonds range between 4 - 40 kJ mol-1.

When a hydrogen atom is bonded to a N, O or F atom, the partial positive charge on
hydrogen atom ( _δ_ +) is much higher compared to the bonding with other atoms. The reason
is the relatively higher electronegativity difference between hydrogen and these
electronegative atoms (N, O, F). Since hydrogen is a smaller atom, a strong electrostatic
field is available. When it has an electrostatic interaction between a hydrogen atom with
a partial positive charge (δ+) and an electronegative atom (N, O, F) with a partial negative
charge (δ-) is called a **hydrogen bond**. It is not necessary that the electronegative atom
with ( _δ_ -) is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H-O, H-N, H-F), but could be any other atom.
(e.g. : Hydrogen bonding between H atom of CHCl 3 and O atom of acetone).

In the Figure 2.42, one water molecule is bonded to another water molecule forming
hydrogen	bonds.	Examples	for	hydrogen	bonds	formed	between	same	molecules are H 2 O
and NH 3.

The model of polarity could be matched with the behaviour and the properties of
molecular substance, e.g.: water. Ice floats on water since it is about 9% less dense than
liquid water. As the thermal energy of water is removed by cooling, kinetic energy of
molecules decreases freezing water to ice at 0 0 C. Lowering of kinetic energy of water
molecules leads to increase the number of hydrogen bonds around each water molecule.
Water molecules become compact in a regular order since each of the water molecule
for ms maximum number of hydrogen bonds with the nearby water molecules when the
kinetic energy is lowered by cooling it to 0 0 C.
```
```
Figure 2. 43 Arrangement of H 2 O molecules in ice
```
```
Each water molecule can form two hydrogen bonds using the two hydrogen atoms and it
can form another two hydrogen bonds by attracting two hydrogen atoms of adjacent water
molecules using two lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom. These four hydrogen
bonds at 0^0 C lead to a compact tetrahedral arrangement around each water molecule. The
arrangement of water molecules in a regular ordered state of ice occupies 9 ] more space
than the free space of liquid water. There are number of crystal structures of ice and the
nature of the crystal structures depends on the condition of cooling.
```
```
However, hydrogen bonds can also be formed as intermolecular interactions among
different molecules. Hydrogen bonding present in a mixture of acetone and water clearly
illustrates this.

Hydrogen bonding in acetic acid is possible between the hydrogen atom in the carboxylic
group and the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group (C=O) of the carboxylic acid group as
indicated below. The electronegative atom with ( _δ_ -) charge is not necessarily bonded to
hydrogen. It shows that the presence of required degree of polarity at H atom and the
other electronegative atoms (O, N, F ) is important, in order to for m hydrogen bonding.

Hydrogen bonds, are present in pure HF. The Figure 2.46 (a) below shows the

When hydrogen bonding is present between two molecules then it is called **inter-

bond.** The hydrogen bonding present in _ortho_ -nitrophenol and _para_ -nitrophenol are given
below in Figure 2.47 to illustrate the difference between inter-molecular and intra-
molecular hydrogen bonding.

Hydrogen bonding in acetic acid is possible between the hydrogen atom in the carboxylic
group and the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group (C=O) of the carboxylic acid group as
indicated below. The electronegative atom with ( _δ_ -) charge is not necessarily bonded to
hydrogen. It shows that the presence of required degree of polarity at H atom and the
other electronegative atoms (O, N, F ) is important, in order to for m hydrogen bonding.

arrangement of HF molecules in pure HF. In the case of a solution of a mixture of HF and

molecules (b).

When hydrogen bonding is present between two molecules then it is called **inter-
molecular hydrogen bond** while hydrogen bonding is present between a hydrogen atom
and an electronegative atom of the same molecule it is called **intra-molecular hydrogen
bond.** The hydrogen bonding present in _ortho_ -nitrophenol and _para_ -nitrophenol are given
below in Figure 2.47 to illustrate the difference between inter-molecular and intra-

In certain cases, possibility of having hydrogen bond is defined (the strength of a
hydrogen bond is less) when the electronegative atom is Cl. Therefore there is another
rule including Cl as well. It is called FONCl rule. In general, stronger hydrogen bonds are
observed between a polarized hydrogen atom (δ+) and polarized F, O or N atom (δ-).
**Ion – induced dipole interactions**
Iodine (I 2 ) is a non-polar molecule which is slightly soluble in water. However, iodine in
solid state can be dissolved in an aqueous KI solution. This observation can only be
explained with ion –induced dipole interactions. In this case, interaction of an iodide ion
(I−) can induce a dipole on an iodine molecule. The positive pole of induced dipole
interacts with I−^ ion to combine I 2 molecule in order to form the I 3 −^ ion. Hence, I 2
dissolves in KI solution.
**Figure 2. 48** Ion –induced dipole interactions
Therefore, ion – induced dipole interactions can make iodine soluble in an aqueous KI
solution.

**Dipole – induced dipole interaction**
This is a weak attractive force that results when a polar molecule induces a dipole in an
atom or a nonpolar molecule. The polarization of outer electron cloud of atom or nonpolar
molecule takes place as a result of the impact of electrostatic force of the dipole of the
polar molecule.

This interaction energy is proportional to 1/ r^6 where “r” is the distance between two
molecules. The magnitude of dipole moment of induced dipole depends upon
polarizability of nonpolar molecule or atom and the magnitude of the dipole moment of
the polar	molecule.	The	interaction	between	HCl	molecule	and	Ar	atom	is	one	example.

```

**London interactions (forces) (Instantaneous induced dipole – induced dipole
interaction)**
Non polar molecules are held together by weak interactions. These interactions are also
present in gas, liquid and solid states of inert elements and these weak interactions are
called **London forces**. Though the molecule is non-polar, due to continuous movement
of electrons, regions of relatively high and low electron densities are created
instantaneously. However, location of these two poles can instantaneously change in the
next	moment.	Interaction	between	a	momentarily	polarized	dipole	of a molecule with an
oppositely charged such a dipole of another molecule ( _δ_ +--- _δ_ - ) is a London interactions.
They are also called dispersion forces. Molecule has a high probability for forming
London interaction when the surface area of the molecule is large. The net strength of
interaction between two molecules is significant as they have relatively large surface
areas.

London	forces	exist	among all the atoms and molecules irrespective of whether they are
polar or non-polar. In determining physical properties of molecules having larger
molecular weights, dispersion forces are likely to be more important than dipole – dipole
forces exist	 between	 them. London forces are the dominant interactions in order to
compact the iodine molecules in solid state.

**Compacting of iodine molecules in solid state**
Iodine is a nonpolar molecule and solid state of iodine is considered to be a molecular
crystal. Iodine molecule is a heavy molecule having a large size. Thermal energy at room
temperature is not sufficient for molecular movement of iodine molecules in the solid
state. London forces hold these molecules in an orderly arrangement in the solid state.

Large surface area of the I 2 molecule creates London forces with neighbouring molecules
giving rise to a molecular lattice structure. Since I 2 molecules are nonpolar, solubility of
iodine is greater in non-polar solvents than in polar solvents.

Molar masses of NO and O 2 are comparable but boiling point of NO is greater than O 2.
Hence, the relative strength of inter molecular interaction forces among NO molecules
should be greater than the intermolecular interaction strength among O 2 molecules. The
model	of	dipole	moment	and	polarity	of	molecule	can	be	used	to	explain	this	observation.	
NO is a molecule with atoms of different electronegativity and hence, it is a polar
molecule having a dipole moment (0.153	D).	Oxygen	molecule	is	a	nonpolar molecule
with zero dipole moment. Polar NO has dipole–dipole attractions among the molecules.
Nonpolar	oxygen	molecules have relatively weak London interactions. Hence, liquid NO
needs more energy than	liquid	oxygen in order to break the intermolecular interactions in
the liquid state.
Molecules of bromine (Br 2 ) and iodine monochloride (ICl) are isoelectronic. Bromine
molecules are non-polar and liquid Br 2 boils at 59^0 C. ICl consists of polar molecules and
boils at 97^0 C almost 40^0 C higher. The boiling point indicates that intermolecular forces


```
G. C. E. (A/L) CHEMISTRY: UNIT 2 Structure and Bonding
```
among ICl molecules are stronger than those of Br 2. Any substance with strong dipole-
dipole forces has to absorb substantially more energy to melt and boil.

The net strength of intermolecular attraction also depends on the molecular shape.
Electrons in elongated molecules are easily polarized or distorted. For example,
_n_ - pentane boils at 3 6 0 C, whereas _neo_ -pentane boils at 9 0 C. Boiling points increase with
increasing attraction among molecules. Hence the London forces in _n_ - pentane are
stronger than those in _neo_ -pentane. This is because the spherical shape of _neo_ -pentane
molecule and the valence electrons in C-C bonds are well shielded from the CH 3 groups
whereas _n_ - pentane is chain shaped so that valence electrons in C-C bonds are more
exposed in order to form London interaction.

**Introduction**
Basic mathematical calculations used in chemistry and the knowledge required in respect
of understanding c hemistry principles are acquired in this unit.

**3.1 Oxidation number**
Oxidation	number is used to determine the number of electrons transfer between
atoms/ions in compounds and molecules. The	oxidation	number describes the loss or gain
of electrons from an atom in a chemical compound. The	oxidation	number describes the
charge that an atom would have if all bonds are considered to be ionic with no covalent
component. The oxidation	number of an atom in a covalent compound is found by
assigning the electrons shared by atoms to the particular atom as follows:
(a) For **covalent bonds formed between similar atoms** – When there is no
electronegativity difference between the two bonded atoms, the electrons are split
equally between the atoms. For such bonds the	oxidation	number of atoms is zero.
(b) For **covalent bonds formed between different atoms** – When the covalent
molecule is made up of different atoms the bonded electrons are not shared equally
between the atoms. In these bonds, the bonded electrons are assigned to the atom
that has the highest electronegativity. Accordingly, plus	 and	 minus	 oxidation	
numbers are introduced to	explain	the	oxidation	number.

The structural formula of a molecule shows a graphic representation of its molecular
structure and how the atoms are arranged. It also can be used to assign the	oxidation	
number to each atom in the molecule using the electronegativity difference between the
component atoms. This approach is mainly used to determine	the	oxidation	number of
atoms in covalent bonds. In this method, each pair of electrons in a covalent bond must
be assigned to the most electronegative atom accordingly. The most electronegative atom
gains the electron and it is marked with a (-1) charge. The atom that has less
electronegativity loses an electron and it is marked with a (+1) charge. After assigning

3.1.2 Use of oxidation numbers to understand electron transfer between atoms in
redox reactions**
New products are formed by transfer of electrons from one atom to another when
chemicals react. Consider the reaction between solid sodium and chlorine gas;
2Na(s) + Cl 2 (g) 2NaCl(s)
In this reaction, elemental sodium and chlorine become a positively charged sodium ion
and negatively charged chloride ion respectively. (Na+ and Clˉ).
In such reactions, one or more electrons are transferred from one atom to another atom.
Reactions showing such electron transfers are called **oxidation-reduction reactions** or
**redox reactions**.
 The loss of an electron/s from an atom/ ion is called **oxidation**.
 Conversely the gain of an electron/s by an atom/ ion is called **reduction**.
**Oxidation (** Loss of electrons) Na(g) Na+(g) + e
0 +1
In	oxidation,	oxidation number of an atom/ion increases. Therefore	sodium	is	oxidized	
to sodium ion.
**Reduction** (Gain of electrons) Cl 2 (g) + 2e 2Clˉ(g)
0 - 1
In reduction, oxidation number of an atom/ion decreases. Therefore chlorine is reduced
to chloride ions.
In the	above	example, chlorine is identified as	the	oxidizing	agent and sodium is the
reducing agent.
Further examples	are	given	below	to	help to understand the electron transfer that occurs
in redox	reactions.	
Example	1: Combustion of methane (CH 4 )
This can be shown using the following balanced equation. In this reaction,	oxidation	
numbers of C and O is changed when CO 2 and H 2 O are formed as products.
_Reaction_ CH 4 (g) + 2O 2 (g) CO 2 (g) + 2H 2 O(l)
_Oxidation number_ C = - 4 O = 0 C = +4 H = +1
H = +1 O = - 2 O = - 2
The oxidation number of hydrogen remains unchanged.
The	oxidation	number of carbon changes from -4 to +4. Therefore, carbon is
oxidized.
The	oxidation	number of	oxygen	changes	from 0 to -2.	Therefore,	oxygen	is reduced.

```
Oxidation reaction: Carbon in CH 4 is oxidized	to	produce	CO2.
Each	carbon	atom	loses 8 electrons.
Reduction reaction: Oxygen	is reduced to produce H 2 O and CO 2.
Each	oxygen	atom	gains	2	electrons.
```
Example	2: Combustion of propane (C 3 H 8 )
This is shown using the following balanced equation. In this reaction,	oxidation	numbers
of C and O will change when CO 2 and H 2 O are formed as products.

```
```
(-3)+(-2)+(-3) = - 8
(+4)×3 = +12
```
```
The cumulative oxidation	number of the three carbons changes from - 8 to +12.
Therefore, there is a total of 20 electrons loss when forming the product CO 2. Hence
carbon	is	oxidized.
```
```
The	oxidation	number of oxygen	changes from 0 to -2 in the product. Therefore, there
is a total of 4 electrons gain when forming the product of two O2-. Hence oxygen	is	
reduced.
```
```
Oxidation reaction: Carbon in CH 3 CH 2 CH 3 (g) is oxidized	to	produce	CO 2.
Reduction reaction: Oxygen	is reduced to produce H 2 O and CO 2.
```
Example	3: Formation of propane (C 3 H 8 ) from propene (C 3 H 6 )
This is shown	using	the	following	balanced	equation.	In	this	reaction,	oxidation	numbers
of C in C 3 H 8 will change when C 3 H 6 is produced and this can be shown as follows.

```
Reaction xCH 3 yCHzCH 2 (g) + H 2 (g) xCH 3 yCH 2 zCH 3 (g)

_Oxidation number_ xC= - 3 , yC =- 1 , zC= - (^2) H=0 xC= - 3 ,^ yC= - 2 , zC= - 3
_Cumulative
oxidation number of
carbon_
(-3)+(-1)+(-2) = - 6^ H=0 (-3) + (-2) + (-3) = - 8
The cumulative oxidation	number of the three carbons changes from - 6 to - 8.
Therefore, there is a total of 2 electrons **gain** when forming the product. Hence carbon
is reduced.

Reduction reaction: Oxygen	is reduced to produce H 2 O and CO 2.
Each	oxygen	atom	gains	2	electrons.
```
Example	2: Combustion of propane (C 3 H 8 )
This is shown using the following balanced equation. In this reaction,	oxidation	numbers
of C and O will change when CO 2 and H 2 O are formed as products.

```

```
```
(-3)+(-2)+(-3) = - 8
(+4)×3 = +12
```
```
The cumulative oxidation	number of the three carbons changes from - 8 to +12.
Therefore, there is a total of 20 electrons loss when forming the product CO 2. Hence
carbon	is	oxidized.
```
```
The	oxidation	number of oxygen	changes from 0 to - 2 in the product. Therefore, there
is a total of 4 electrons gain when forming the product of two O^2 -. Hence oxygen	is	
reduced.
```
```
Oxidation reaction: Carbon in CH 3 CH 2 CH 3 (g) is oxidized	to	produce	CO 2.
Reduction reaction: Oxygen	is reduced to produce H 2 O and CO 2.
```
Example	3: Formation of propane (C 3 H 8 ) from propene (C 3 H 6 )
This is shown	using	the	following	balanced	equation.	In	this	reaction,	oxidation	numbers
of C in C 3 H 8 will change when C 3 H 6 is produced and this can be shown as follows.

```
Reaction xCH 3 yCHzCH 2 (g) + H 2 (g) xCH 3 yCH 2 zCH 3 (g)
```
_Oxidation number_ xC= - 3 , yC =- 1 , zC= - (^2) H=0 xC= - 3 ,^ yC= - 2 , zC= - 3
_Cumulative
oxidation number of
carbon_
(-3)+(-1)+(-2) = - 6 H=0 (-3) + (-2) + (-3) = - 8
The cumulative oxidation	number of the three carbons changes from - 6 to - 8.
Therefore, there is a total of 2 electrons **gain** when forming the product. Hence carbon
is reduced.
**G. C. E. (A/L) CHEMISTRY: UNIT 3 Chemical Calculations**
The	oxidation number of hydrogen changes from 0 to +1in the product. Therefore,
there is a 2 electrons **loss** in respect of hydrogen^ when forming the two H+ in the
product C 3 H 8. Hence hydrogen is oxidized.
_Reduction reaction:_ Carbon in CH 3 CHCH 2 (g) is reduced to produce CH 3 CH 2 CH 3 (g)
_Oxidation reaction:_ Hydrogen is	oxidized to produce CH 3 CH 2 CH 3 (g).
**3.2 Nomenclature of inorganic compounds**
IUPAC recommendations for nomenclature are used in the systematic way of naming
compounds. IUPAC stands for _International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry_.
This section deals only with the inorganic nomenclature. With the aid of nomenclature
chemical compounds can be specified with a unique name.
Trivial names (name used before the IUPAC nomenclature was introduced) are often
still commonly used for some compounds in addition to the IUPAC names.
**3.2.1 Names of ionic compounds derived f rom monoatomic ions**
The way of writing the unmodified name for the monoatomic cation and then writing
the modified name for the monoatomic anion with the	suffix	- **_ide_** at the end is shown
in the Table 3.2.
**Table 3.2** Names of common monoatomic ions
**Cation Name Anion Name**
H+ hydrogen Hˉ hydride
Na+ sodium Clˉ chloride
K+ potassium Brˉ bromide
Ca2+ calcium O^2 ˉ oxide
Al3+^ aluminium S^2 ˉ sulfide
Zn2+ zinc N^3 ˉ nitride
Rules for writing the name of ionic compounds with an element that can only form
one type of cation:

1. Name of the cation must always come first.
2. Name of the cation is the name of its element.
3. Name	of	the	anion	is	the	part	of	its	element	name	and	the	suffix	– _ide_.
4. Leave a space between the name of the cation and the anion.
Applications	are	shown	in	the	examples	below.
e.g.: NaCl - sodium chloride
MgO - magnesium	oxide
CsBr - c aesium bromide

```
3.2.2 Names of ionic compounds derived from elements that form more than one
type of cations
The metal ions with variable oxidation	numbers form more than one type of cations.
In the trivial names,	 suffix – ic for the cation of higher charge (higher oxidation	
number) and – ous for the cation of lower charge (lower oxidation	number) are used.
```

3.2.3 Names of simple covalent compounds
Many elements form covalent compounds. When naming this type of compounds, the
element with	the	positive	oxidation	 number must be written first followed by the
element	with	the	negative	oxidation number.
```
```
Rules for writing the name of simple covalent compounds:
```
1. First part of the name is written representing the less electronegative element
    and the second part of the name is written indicating the more electronegative
    element in the compound.
2. Write the name of the compound leaving a space between the first part and the
    second part.
3. Name the most electronegative atom by modifying its name with the	suffix	
    - _ide._
4. Prefixes	are	used	to	represent	the	number of similar atoms in the compound.
    Based on the number of similar atoms	prefixes	are	given	as	follows.	
    1 = _mono_ , 2 = _di_ , 3 = _tri_ , 4 = _tetra_ , 5 = _penta_ , 6 = _hexa_ , 7 = _hepta_ , 8 = _octa_
    However, the	prefix	 _mono_ is never used when naming the first element.
5. When	the	prefix	ends	in	“ _a”_ or “ _o”_ and the second element name begins with
    “ _a”_ or “ _o”_ ,	the	final	vowel	of	the	prefix	is	dropped	for	ease	of	pronunciation.	
    e.g.: mono	+	oxide	=	monoxide
    tetra	+	oxide			=	teroxide
e.g. : CO - carbon	monoxide
H 2 S - dihydrogen monosulfide
SO 3 - sulfur	trioxide
N 2 O 3 - dinitrogen	trioxide

**3.3 Atomic mass, mole and Avogadro constant
3.3.1 The connection among atomic mass unit, mole and Avogadro constant**
Since atoms are so small, the normal units of mass such as grams and kilograms are
inconvenient	to	express	their	mass. Hence a smaller unit of mass called atomic mass unit
(u) was introduced. Atomic	mass	is	the	mass	of	an	atom	of	a	chemical	element	expressed	


```
G. C. E. (A/L) CHEMISTRY: UNIT 3 Chemical Calculations
```
in atomic mass units. Different types of isotopes are found in elements. For an example,	
carbon has three isotopes namely 12 C,^13 C and^14 C. Therefore commonly average atomic
mass of elements are used as the atomic mass.

**3.3.2 Calculation of average atomic mass of elements**
The average atomic mass of any atom can be calculated in the following way, illustrated
for carbon and chlorine as typical elements.
Example	1:
The calculation of average atomic mass of natural carbon.
The mass percentage of the isotopes in a sample of carbon is 98.89% of^12 C, 1.11% of^13 C
and the amount of^14 C is negligibly small.

Mass of a sample of 100 natural carbon atoms = [(98.89 × 12 u) + (1.11 × 13 u)]
The average atomic mass of natural carbon atom = [(98.89 × 12 u) + (1.11 × 13 u)]/ 100
= 12.01 u

Example	2:
The calculation of average atomic mass of chlorine.
The mass percentage of the isotopes in a sample of chlorine is 75.77% of^35 Cl and
24.23% of^37 Cl.
.
Mass of a sample of 100 natural chlorine = [(75.77 × 35 u) + (24.23 × 37 u)]
atoms
The average atomic mass of natural = [(75.77×34.97 u)+(24.23×36.97 u)]/ 100
chlorine atom = 35.45 u

**3.3.3 Mole**
The amount of substance containing the same number of units/ entities equal to the
number	of	atoms	in	exactly	12	g	of	^12 C or Avogadro’s number is referred to as one
mole.

Given	below	are	examples	for	the	number of entities contained in one mole of elements,
molecules or ions.
1 mol of^12 C contains 6.022 × 10^23 of^12 C atoms.
1 mol of C 6 H 12 O 6 contains 6.022 × 10^23 of C 6 H 12 O 6 molecules.
1 mol of CaCl 2 contains 6.022 × 10^23 of Ca2+ ions.

This concept can be used to understand further the relationship between the use of u and
gram to count the number of atoms. Since 6.022 × 10^23 atoms of^12 C have a mass of
exactly 12 g, and each^12 C atom has a mass of 12 u, then,
1 u = 1.66 × 10-24 g
6.022 × 10^23 u = 1 g
(6.022 × 10^23 atoms) × (12 u/1 atom) = 12.00 g

in atomic mass units. Different types of isotopes are found in elements. For an example,	
carbon has three isotopes namely 12 C,^13 C and^14 C. Therefore commonly average atomic
mass of elements are used as the atomic mass.

**3.3.2 Calculation of average atomic mass of elements**

The average atomic mass of natural carbon atom = [(98.89 × 12 u) + (1.11 × 13 u)]/ 100
= 12.01 u

Example	2:
The calculation of average atomic mass of chlorine.
The mass percentage of the isotopes in a sample of chlorine is 75.77% of^35 Cl and
24.23% of^37 Cl.
.
Mass of a sample of 100 natural chlorine = [(75.77 × 35 u) + (24.23 × 37 u)]
atoms
The average atomic mass of natural = [(75.77×34.97 u)+(24.23×36.97 u)]/ 100
chlorine atom = 35.45 u

**3.3.3 Mole**
The amount of substance containing the same number of units/ entities equal to the
number	of	atoms	in	exactly	12	g	of	^12 C or Avogadro’s number is referred to as one
mole.

Given	below	are	examples	for	the	number of entities contained in one mole of elements,
molecules or ions.
1 mol of^12 C contains 6.022 × 10^23 of^12 C atoms.
1 mol of C 6 H 12 O 6 contains 6.022 × 10^23 of C 6 H 12 O 6 molecules.
1 mol of CaCl 2 contains 6.022 × 10^23 of Ca2+ ions.

This concept can be used to understand further the relationship between the use of u and
gram to count the number of atoms. Since 6.022 × 10^23 atoms of^12 C have a mass of
exactly 12 g, and each^12 C atom has a mass of 12 u, then,
1 u = 1.66 × 10-24 g
6.022 × 10^23 u = 1 g
(6.022 × 10^23 atoms) × (12 u/1 atom) = 12.00 g

3.3.4 Molar mass
The molar mass is the mass of one mole of the substance. This is calculated as the mass
of the given substance (chemical element or chemical compound) divided by the amount
(moles) of that substance. The SI unit of molar mass is kg mol-1. However usually molar
mass	is	expressed in g mol-1.
molar mass of O = 16.00 g mol-1
molar mass of H 2 = 2 × 1.008 g mol-1 = 2.016 g mol-1
molar mass of H 2 O = (2 × 1.008 g mol-1) + 16.00 g mol-1
= 18.016 g mol-1
```
```
A mass of 18.016 g of water contains, Avogadro constant (one mol) of water molecules.

```
3.4 Types of chemical formulae
The chemical formula is used to represent the type of atoms and the number of atoms with
the element symbols of each atom showing their exact	numbers. More than one type of
chemical formulae can be used to represent information of a compound. Two types of
chemical formulae are discussed in this section which are used for chemical calculations.
```
```
(a) Empirical formula
This is the simplest type of formula derived from the composition of the atomic
masses of the elements in a compound. The relative number of atoms of each
element in a compound is shown using the empirical formula.
e.g. : For	hydrogen	peroxide	(H 2 O 2 ), the empirical formula is HO.
For ethane (C 2 H 6 ), the empirical formula is CH3.
For benzene (C 6 H 6 ), the empirical formula is CH.
For ethyne (C 2 H 2 ), the empirical formula is CH.
```
```
(b) Molecular formula
The molecular formula is the formula that shows the actual number of atoms of
each element in a molecule of a compound.
```
```
Example 3. 1
Calculate the molar mass of NaCl.
```
```
Answer:
Molar mass of Na+ = 22.99 g mol-1
Molar mass of Clˉ = 35.45 g mol-1
Molar mass of NaCl = 22.99 g mol-1 + 35.45 g mol-1
= 58.44 g mol-1
A mass of 58.44 g NaCl contains one mole of Na+ ions and one mol of Clˉ ions. It
also contains one mole of NaCl.

```
e.g.: The molecular formula	of	hydrogen	peroxide	is	H 2 O2.
The molecular formula of ethane is C 2 H6.
The molecular formula of benzene is C 6 H6.
The molecular formula of ethyne is C 2 H2.^
```
**3.4.1 Chemical calculations using chemical formulae**

**Mass percentage of an element in the chemical formula**
The mass percentage of a given element in a compound can be determined using the
following equations.

Always cumulative individual mass percentages of all elements in a compound adds up
to 100%. As	an	example	the	calculation of mass percentage of carbon and hydrogen of
ethane is given below.

**3.4.2 Determination of the empirical and molecular formula of a compound**

**Basic steps to determine the empirical formula**
1. Obtain the mass of each element present in the compound concerned in grams.

2. Divide each mass by the molar mass of the corresponding element to determine
    the number of moles of each type of element present.
3. Divide the number of moles of each element by the smallest number of moles
    obtained in step 2, to convert the smallest number to 1. If all numbers produced
    are integers or very close to integers, then these numbers represent the subscript
    values of each element in the empirical formula. However, if one or more
    numbers are not integers, then follow the step 4.

```
Example 3. 2
Calculate the mass percentage of carbon and hydrogen of ethane
```
```
Answer:
Molecular formula of ethane is C 2 H 6.
Two	moles	of	carbon	and	six	moles	of	hydrogen	are	present	in	one	mole	of	ethane.
```
Mass percentage of carbon = (^) 2 mol × 12 g mol-
(
1
2 mol ×12 g mol-^1 )+(6 mol ×1 g mol-^1 )×^100

**3.4.1 Chemical calculations using chemical formulae**

**Mass percentage of an element in the chemical formula**
The mass percentage of a given element in a compound can be determined using the
following equations.

Always cumulative individual mass percentages of all elements in a compound adds up
to 100%. As	an	example	the	calculation of mass percentage of carbon and hydrogen of
ethane is given below.

**3.4.2 Determination of the empirical and molecular formula of a compound**

**Basic steps to determine the empirical formula**
1. Obtain the mass of each element present in the compound concerned in grams.

2. Divide each mass by the molar mass of the corresponding element to determine
    the number of moles of each type of element present.
3. Divide the number of moles of each element by the smallest number of moles
    obtained in step 2, to convert the smallest number to 1. If all numbers produced
    are integers or very close to integers, then these numbers represent the subscript
    values of each element in the empirical formula. However, if one or more
    numbers are not integers, then follow the step 4.

```
Example 3. 2
Calculate the mass percentage of carbon and hydrogen of ethane
```
```
Answer:
Molecular formula of ethane is C 2 H 6.
Two	moles	of	carbon	and	six	moles	of	hydrogen	are	present	in	one	mole	of	ethane.
```
Mass percentage of carbon = (^) 2 mol × 12 g mol-

2 mol ×12 g mol-^1 )+(6 mol ×1 g mol-^1 )×^100

###### = 80 %

Mass percentage of hydrogen = (^) 6 mol × 1 g mol-^1
(2 mol ×12 g mol-^1 )+(6 mol ×1 g mol-^1 )×^100
= 20%
**G. C. E. (A/L) CHEMISTRY: UNIT 3 Chemical Calculations**
4.
Multiply the numbers produced at the end of step 3 by the smallest possible
integer that will convert all of them to whole numbers.
(When the decimal value is less than 2 or more than 8, round off the number to
the closest integer).
These numbers represent the subscript values of each element in the empirical
formula.
**3.4.3 Determination of molecular formula using the empirical formula mass and
molecular mass**

1. Calculate the empirical formula mass from the empirical formula.
2. Divide the molecular mass by the empirical formula mass.
3. The division produces a whole number.
4. Multiply the subscripts in the empirical formula by this number to determine the
    molecular formula.

```
An	example	to	understand	the	above process is given below.
```
```
Example 3. 3
Determine the molecular formula of a compound with the elemental percentages of
Cl = 71.65%, C =24.27% and H = 4.07% and the molar mass of the compound is
98 g mol-1
```
```
Answer:
Step 01: Mass percentages: Cl = 71.65%, C = 24.27%, H = 4.07%
Step 02: In 100 g of the compound; Cl= 71.65 g, C=24.27 g and H=4.07 g
Atomic masses of Cl = 35.5, C = 12 and H = 1.
In 100 g of the compound, number of moles present;
Moles of Cl = 71.65 g/35.5 g mol-1 = 2.043 mol
Moles of C = 24.27 g/ 12 g mol-1 = 2.022 mol
Moles of H = 4.07 g/ 1 g mol-1 = 4.07 mol
Step 03: Cl = 2.043 ÷ 2.022
= 1.01
```
```
C = 2.022 ÷ 2.022
= 1
```
```
H = 4.07 ÷ 2.022
= 2.01
Step 04:
Empirical	formula	=	CH 2 Cl
Empirical	formula	mass	=	49	g mol-1
If molar mass of the compound is known, then the chemical
formula of the compound can be determined.
```
```
Step 05: Molecular^ formula^ mass
Empirical formula mass = 98 g mol
```
```
-1 ÷ 49 g mol-1 = 2
```
```
Molecular formula = (empirical formula) × 2
= (CH 2 Cl) 2 ×2 = C 2 H 4 Cl 2

The mole fraction (𝑥𝑥), is the ratio between the amount of moles of a component and the
total amount of moles of all the components present	in	the	mixture.

**3.5.4 Molarity (Commonly used to express concentration)**
The volume of a solution can be measured more conveniently than its mass. The

**Example 3.4
Calculate the mole fraction and the mole percentage of a 20.0% hydrogen
peroxide solution by mass.
Answer:**
Mole fraction of H 2 O 2 (𝑋𝑋𝐻𝐻 2 𝑂𝑂 2 ) = _n_ H 2 O 2 / _n_ total = [(moles of(moles H^ of^ H^2 O^2 )

In the hydrogen	peroxide	solution,	mass	of	H 2 O 2 = 200.0 g, mass of H 2 O

moles of H 2 O 2 = 200.0 g/ 34 g mol-1 = 5.88 mol
moles of H 2 O = 800.0 g/ 18 g mol-1 = 44.44 mol
Mole fraction of H 2 O 2 = 5.88 mol/ (5.88 + 44.44) mol = 0.116
Mole percentage of H 2 O 2 = mole fraction (𝑋𝑋𝐻𝐻 2 𝑂𝑂 2 ) × 100 = 11.6%

The amounts of water used to prepare 1.25 mol dm-3 and 1.25 mol kg-1, sucrose solutions
are not the same due to the density criteria. This means, for a given solution, the molarity
and the molality are not the same, however the difference can be negligible for dilute
solutions.
**3.6 Balancing chemical reactions**
The chemicals initially involved in a reaction are called reactants. Substances formed
from a chemical reaction are called products. Chemical changes can yield one or more
products. A	chemical	change	such	as	carbon	combining	with	oxygen	to	produce	carbon	
dioxide	is	an	example	of a chemical reaction. This chemical reaction can be represented
using the chemical equation given below.

Reactants Products
**Examples 3. 5
A solution of NaCl is prepared by mixing 10 mg of NaCl and 500 g of water.
Calculate the molality and the composition (in ppm) of the solution.
Answer:**
To calculate the molality of the solution,
Molality (m) = moles of the solute/ mass of the solvent
Amount of moles of NaCl = 0.01 g/ 58.5 g mol-^1 = 1.71 × 10-^4 mol
Molality (m) = moles of the solute/ mass of the solvent = 1.71 × 10-^4 mol/ 0.5 kg
= 3.42 × 10-4 mol kg-1
Composition of NaCl (ppm)
Composition = (mass of NaCl (in grams)/ mass of the solution (in grams)) × 10^6
= (0.01 g/(500 + 0.01)g)× 10^6 = 19.9 ppm

During a chemical reaction, atoms are neither created nor destroyed. Hence, there is a
mass balance between reactants and products. In other words the total number of atoms
in the reaction molecules is equal to the total number of atoms in the product molecules.
A chemical reaction which depicts the aforesaid material balance is known as a **balance
chemical reaction**.

Any balanced chemical reaction must obey these rules.

**Rules for balancing a chemical equation**
(a) Number of atoms of the reactant side must be equal to the respective numbers of
atoms of the product side.
(b) Formulae of reactants and products must never be changed to balance a given
chemical equation.
(c) All parts of any balanced chemical equation can be divided or multiplied by any
number to produce a new balanced equation.
(d) The best balanced (accepted) equation is the one that has the smallest whole
number ratio between reactants and products. These integers are called
**“coefficients”** of the balanced equation. These coefficient numbers are expressed	
as **stoichiometric numbers** in a balanced equation.

There are two methods of balancing chemical equations.
(a) Inspection method
(b) Redox	method

**3.6.1 Balancing a chemical reaction by inspection method**
Step 1: Identify the reactants, products and their physical states. Write the appropriate
formulae and the unbalanced chemical equation.
Step 2: Balance the equation by inspection, starting with the element/s which appears
at the least number of places. Continue element by element to determine the
coefficients to balance the atoms on both the reactants and products.
Step 3: Use coefficients to balance the atoms/ ions on both sides of the arrow. Also,
check whether the coefficients used are the smallest integers that can be used
to balance the equation.

Simple chemical equations can be balanced using the inspection method. Consider the
examples given below.

```

sulphate and water.

Method 01 - Oxidation number change method
This considers the change	in	oxidation	number	and	uses them as coefficients of reactants.
As	an	example, the reaction between S and HNO 3 is shown below. The following steps
are applied to balance the equation.
Step 1: Correctly write the formulae for the reactants and the products of the chemical
reaction.
S(s) + HNO 3 (aq) H 2 SO 4 (aq) + NO 2 (aq) + H 2 O(l)

**Method 02 - Half reaction method**
In every	oxidation-reduction reaction, one reactant is reduced and another reactant is
oxidized.	In	some	cases	the	same	atom	in	the	reactant	is	oxidized	and	reduced	and	such	
reactions are called disproportionation reactions. These two reactions	 (oxidation	 and
reduction) are referred to as half reactions. The relevant steps to identify and balance the
redox	reaction	using half reactions is given below.

**Steps to balance redox reactions**
Step A: Split the reaction into two half ionic reactions.
Step B: Balance both half ionic equations separately.
Step C: Combine the two half reactions to give a simplified balance equation and
the final balanced chemical reaction.

Limiting reagent/ reactant
In a reaction mixture, the reactant that is completely consumed is called the limiting
reactant.	Other	reactants	are	called	excess	reactants.	The	following	example	shows	the	
use of limiting reagent concept to calculate the amount of product produced by a given
reaction.
Example: How many moles of NH 3 can be produced from 3 mol of N 2 and 6 mol of
H 2?
Balanced chemical equation;
N 2 (g) + 3H 2 (g) 2NH 3 (g)
```
```
The number of moles of H 2 required to complete consumption of 3 moles of N 2
= number of moles of N 2 × 3 = 9 mol
The required amount of moles is greater than the available amount of moles of H 2.
Therefore the limiting reagent is H 2.
```
```
The amount of N 2 moles required for complete consumption of 6 moles of H 2.
= amount of H 2 moles × 1/3 = 2 mol
The required number of moles of N 2 is less than the available number of moles of N 2.
Therefore the excess	reagent	is N 2.
Based on the amount of limiting reagent (H 2 ), the amount of product (NH 3 ) formed
= amount of H 2 moles × 2/3 = 6 mol × 2/3 = 4 moles of NH 3

**3.7 Preparation of solutions**
When a solute is dissolved	in	a	solvent	to	form	a	homogeneous	mixture	it	is	known	as	a	
solution.
The solutions prepared with exactly	known concentrations are called **standard solutions**.
These standard solutions are standardized against primary standards. If a standard
solution is prepared by using extremely	 pure,	 stable,	 not hydrated and highly water
soluble compounds with higher molecular weights are considered as primary standards.
Few	examples	for	such	compounds	are	anhydrous	Na 2 CO 3 , K 2 Cr 2 O 7 , and KIO 3.
A secondary standard is a chemical that has been standardized against a primary standard
for use in specific analysis.

    a. Calculate the required number of moles and then the required mass of Na 2 CO3.
    b. Accurately weigh the required amount of Na 2 CO 3 using a balance.
    c. Place the Na 2 CO 3 weighed in a 500.00 cm^3 volumetric flask and dissolve well
       with distilled water (The solute should be dissolved completely by using a
       minimum amount of water).
    d. Dilute the solution up to 500.00 cm^3 mark, using distilled water and	mix	well	
       to make a homogeneous solution.

    **(36% (w/w) with a density of 1.17 g ml-1 (1.17 g cm-3)**

```
a. First calculate the concentration of the conc. HCl as follows.
Mass of HCl in 1 dm^3 of conc. HCl acid = 1.17 g cm-3×1000 cm^3 × 36%
= 421.2 g
Number of HCl moles in 1 dm^3 of conc. HCl = 421.2 g ÷ 36.5 g mol-1
Concentration of the conc. HCl acid solution = 11.5 mol dm-3
```
```
b. Calculate the number of moles require to prepare the desired solution.
Amount of HCl moles in 250.00 cm^3 of 1.0 mol dm-3 HCl solution
= (1.0 mol × 250 cm^3 ) ÷ 1000 cm^3
= 0.25 mol^
```
```
The required volume of the concentrated HCl solution is v cm^3 (mL).

    **(36% (w/w) with a density of 1.17 g ml-1 (1.17 g cm-3)**

```
a. First calculate the concentration of the conc. HCl as follows.
Mass of HCl in 1 dm^3 of conc. HCl acid = 1.17 g cm-3×1000 cm^3 × 36%
= 421.2 g
Number of HCl moles in 1 dm^3 of conc. HCl = 421.2 g ÷ 36.5 g mol-1
Concentration of the conc. HCl acid solution = 11.5 mol dm-3
```
```
b. Calculate the number of moles require to prepare the desired solution.
Amount of HCl moles in 250.00 cm^3 of 1.0 mol dm-3 HCl solution
= (1.0 mol × 250 cm^3 ) ÷ 1000 cm^3
= 0.25 mol^
```
```
The required volume of the concentrated HCl solution is v cm^3 (mL).
```
```
The calculation of volume v:
0.25 mol = (11.5 mol × v) ÷ 1000 cm^3
v = 21.7 cm^3

    **Na 2 CO 3 as the stock solution**
       a. Calculate the number of moles in 100.00 cm^3 of 0.2 mol dm-3 Na 2 CO 3
          solution.
       b. Calculate the volume of 1.0 mol dm-3 Na 2 CO 3 needed to prepare 100.00 cm^3
          of 0.2 mol dm-3 Na 2 CO 3 solution.
       c. Accurately measure the calculated volume from 1.0 mol dm-3 Na 2 CO 3
          solution and place the solution in a 100.00 cm^3 volumetric flask.
       d. Dilute the solution up to 100.00 cm^3 mark using distilled water.
**4. Preparation of 250.00 cm**^3 **of 1 mol dm-3 HCl solution from 6 mol dm-3 stock**
    **solution of HCl.**
    Assume the volume required from 6 mol dm-3 HCl solution is v cm^3.

```
The calculation for volume v is :
0.25 mol = 6 mol × v/1000 cm^3
v = 41.6 cm^3
```
```
Then accurately measure the volume of 41.60 cm^3 of the 6 mol dm-3 HCl solution and
add into a 250.00 cm^3 volumetric flask. Dialute up to the mark with distilled water to
prepare the required solution.
```
**5. Preparation of 250.00 cm**^3 **of 1 mol dm-3 HCl solution by mixing of two stock**
    **solutions (example: 3 mol dm-3 and 0.5 mol dm-3 HCl solutions)**
    Assume the volume required from the 3 mol dm-3 HCl be v cm^3.
    Therefore the volume required from the 0.5 mol dm-3 HCl be (250.00 - v) cm^3.
    Then the required number of moles of HCl in the solution to be prepared is 0.25 mol.

```
The calculation for volume v is :
(v × 3 mol dm-3/1000) + ((250.00 - v) × 0.5 mol dm-3/1000) = 0.25 mol
v = 50.00 cm^3
The volume required from 3 mol dm-3 HCl = 50.00 cm^3
The volume required from 0.5 mol dm-3 HCl = (250.00 - 50.00) cm^3
```
```
Mix	50.00 cm^3 of 3 mol dm-3 HCl and 200.00 cm^3 of 0.5 mol dm-3 HCl to prepare
the solution of 250.00 cm^3 of 1 mol dm-3 HCl.

3.8 Calculations based on chemical reactions
Chemical reactions can be used to determine the concentration of an aqueous solution
with an unknown amount of a substance using a solution with a known concentration.
The solution with the known concentration (standard solution) reacts with the solution of
an unknown concentration at a known stoichiometry. At the point in which the solution
with an unknown amount of substance completely reacts with the standard, the
```

```

```
concentration of the unknown solution can be calculated using concentration of the
standard solution and the stoichiometry of the reaction.

```
example 1 : Acid-base reaction
Calculate the concentration of Ba(OH) 2 solution which is reacted with a standard
solution of 0.1 mol dm-3 HNO 3. A volume required from 0.1 mol dm-3 HNO 3 to react
completely with 25.00 cm^3 of Ba(OH) 2 is 34.00 cm^3.
The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between nitric acid and barium
hydroxide	is,
2 HNO 3 (aq) + Ba(OH) 2 (aq) Ba(NO 3 ) 2 (aq) + 2H 2 O(l)
```
```
Based on the balanced equation, two moles of HNO 3 react with one mole of Ba(OH)2.
Hence, the stoichiometry between HNO 3 : Ba(OH) 2 is 2:1.
```
```
The calculation of the number of moles of HNO 3 consumed :
Amount of HNO 3 consumed = 0.1 mol ×
34. 00 cm^3
1000 cm^3 = 0.0034 mol^
Amount of HNO 3 consumed = Amount of Ba(OH) 2 in 25.00 cm^3 × 2
0.0034 mol = Concentration of (Ba(OH) 2 × 0.025 dm^3 × 2
Concentration of Ba(OH) 2 = 0.068 mol dm-^3
```
```
example 2 : Redox	reaction
Calculate the volume of 0.6 mol dm-^3 KMnO 4 required to react completely with
27.00 cm^3 of 0.25 mol dm-3 Fe(NO 3 ) 2.
```
```
The balanced chemical reaction between MnO 4 - and Fe2+ is,
MnO 4 −(aq) + 5Fe2+(aq) + 8H+(aq) 5 Fe3+(aq) + Mn2+(aq) + 4H 2 O(l)
The stoichiometry between MnO 4 −: Fe2+is 1:5.
Amount of Fe2+ consumed = 0.25 mol × 27.00 cm^3 /1000 cm^3
= 6.75 × 10-3 mol
The amount of MnO 4 − required = 6.75 × 10-^3 mol ÷ 5
```
```
The volume of KMnO 4 solution required is v c m^3.
The calculation of volume v:
6.75 × 10-3 mol ÷ 5 = 0.6 mol dm-3 × v
v = 0.00225 dm^3 = 2.25 cm^3

solution of 0.1 mol dm-^3 HNO 3. A volume required from 0.1 mol dm-^3 HNO 3 to react

The balanced chemical equation for the reaction between nitric acid and barium
hydroxide	is,
2 HNO 3 (aq) + Ba(OH) 2 (aq) Ba(NO 3 ) 2 (aq) + 2H 2 O(l)

Based on the balanced equation, two moles of HNO 3 react with one mole of Ba(OH) 2.
Hence, the stoichiometry between HNO 3 : Ba(OH) 2 is 2:1.
```
```
The calculation of the number of moles of HNO 3 consumed :
Amount of HNO 3 consumed = 0.1 mol ×
34. 00 cm^3
1000 cm^3 = 0.0034 mol^
Amount of HNO 3 consumed = Amount of Ba(OH) 2 in 25.00 cm^3 × 2
0.0034 mol = Concentration of (Ba(OH) 2 × 0.025 dm^3 × 2
Concentration of Ba(OH) 2 = 0.068 mol dm-^3

27.00 cm^3 of 0.25 mol dm-^3 Fe(NO 3 ) 2.
```
```
The balanced chemical reaction between MnO 4 - and Fe2+ is,
MnO 4 −(aq) + 5Fe2+(aq) + 8H+(aq) 5 Fe3+(aq) + Mn2+(aq) + 4H 2 O(l)
The stoichiometry between MnO 4 −: Fe2+is 1:5.
Amount of Fe2+ consumed = 0.25 mol × 27.00 cm^3 /1000 cm^3
= 6.75 × 10-^3 mol
The amount of MnO 4 − required = 6.75 × 10-^3 mol ÷ 5
```
```
The volume of KMnO 4 solution required is v cm^3.
The calculation of volume v:
6.75 × 10-^3 mol ÷ 5 = 0.6 mol dm-^3 × v
v = 0.00225 dm^3 = 2.25 cm^3

example 3 : Gravimetry
Calculate the mass of BaSO 4 that gets precipitated when a solution of 0.1 mol dm-3
Ba(OH) 2 completely reacts with 30.00 cm^3 of 0.2 mol dm-3 H 2 SO 4 acid^
```
```
The balanced chemical equation is,
H 2 SO 4 (aq) + Ba(OH) 2 (aq) BaSO 4 (s) + 2H 2 O(l)
```
```
Based on the balanced equation,
Calculation of the mass of BaSO 4 (s) formed
Amount of H 2 SO 4 consumed = 0.2 mol dm -^3 ×
30. 00 cm^3
1000 cm^3 = 0.006 mol^
Amount of BaSO 4 precipitated = 0.006 mol
Molar mass of BaSO 4 = 233 g mol-1
Mass of BaSO 4 precipitated = 0.006 mol × 233 g mol-^1
= 1.4 g

**4.1 Group 1 elements**
All Group 1 elements are metals except	hydrogen	which	is a nonmetal. Unlike most other
metals, they have low densities. All Group 1 elements have the valence shell electron
configuration of n _s_^1 therefore^ they are highly reactive.

Sodium can be found naturally as various salts such as NaCl (rock salt) and
Na 2 B 4 O 7 ·10H 2 O	(borax).		Some	examples	of naturally occurring potassium salts are KCl
(sylvite) and KCl.MgCl 2 .6H 2 O (carnallite).

**4.1.1 Group trends**
All alkali metals are lustrous. They are high electrical and thermal conductors. These
metals are soft and become even softer when progress down the group. The melting point
of Group 1 metals decreases down the group. The values given in Table 4.1 below can be
used to understand the trends among these elements. Group 1 metals always show
oxidation	number	of	+1	when	they	form	compounds.	Most	compounds are stable ionic
solids.

to decrease down the group, and	this	can	be	used	to	explain the chemical properties of
Group 1 elements. Reactivity of the Group 1 elements increases down the group.

Group 1 metals show an increase in reactivity with water down the group. The reactivity
trend with water is as follows.
**Li Na K Rb Cs**
Relatively
slow Vigorously^
Vigourously
with ignition Explosively^ Explosively^
Lithium reacts non-vigorously with water or with water vapour available in the air to
produce	lithium	hydroxide	and	hydrogen	gas.	However, both sodium and potassium react
vigorously	with	water	to	produce	metal	hydroxide	and hydrogen gas. These reactions are
highly exothermic	except	with	Li.
**Reactions with oxygen/ air**
Lithium can react both	with	oxygen	and	nitrogen.	When	heated,	lithium	burns	to	produce	
lithium	oxide	(Li 2 O), a white powder. With nitrogen gas, lithium gives lithium nitride
(Li 3 N). However, both sodium and potassium do not react with nitrogen gas. When
sodium	is	burnt	in	air,	sodium	peroxide	is	mainly	produced	with	some	sodium	oxide.	In
contrast, when potassium is burnt in air, potassium superoxide is formed as the main
product with	 some	 potassium	 oxide	 and	potassium peroxide.	 Oxidation	 numbers	 of	
oxygen	in	sodium	or potassium peroxide	are -1 and in potassium superoxide, oxidation	
numbers are -1 and 0.
Group	1	metal	oxides react	with	water	to	produce	metal	hydroxides	as	shown	below.

When heated, lithium forms lithium nitride with nitrogen. Only lithium forms a stable
alkali-metal nitride. With water, lithium nitride produces ammonia	and	lithium	hydroxide.

Sodium hydrogen carbonate is less soluble than sodium carbonates in water.

**Reactions with hydrogen gas**
Group 1 elements react with hydrogen to produce solid, ionic metal hydrides. In these
hydrides, hydrogen has the oxidation	 number	 of	–1. These metal hydrides react
vigorously with water to produce hydrogen gas.

```
2Na(s) + H 2 (g) 2NaH(s)
```
```
NaH(s) + H 2 O(l) NaOH(aq) + H 2 (g)
```
**Reactions with acids**
Lithium, sodium and potassium react vigorously with dilute acids to produce hydrogen
gas and relevant metal salts. These reactions are highly	exothermic	and	explosive.	A	few
selected reactions are shown below.

```
2Li(s) + dil. 2HNO 3 (aq) 2LiNO 3 (aq) + H 2 (g)

```
**4.1.3 Thermal stability of salts
Decomposition of nitrates**
Group 1 nitrates are used as fertilizers and explosives.	These	nitrates	decompose	upon	
heating. LiNO 3 decomposes	 to	 produce	 lithium	 oxide, nitrogen	 dioxide	and oxygen.	
However, the other Group 1 nitrates on heating produce relevant metal nitrite and	oxygen.

heating. LiNO 3 decomposes	 to	 produce	 lithium	 oxide, nitrogen	 dioxide	and oxygen.	
However, the other Group 1 nitrates on heating produce relevant metal nitrite and	oxygen.

4.1.4 Solubility of Group 1 salts
All	Group	1	salts	are	soluble	in	water	except	some	lithium	salts	such	as	LiF,	Li 2 CO 3 and
Li 3 PO 4. All these salts are white solids unless the salt anion is a coloured ion.

Solubility of Group 1 halides increase down the group is shown in Table 4.2.

```
Variation in the solubility can be understood using the energy cycle for the solvation of
ionic solids. The	solubility	can	be	explained	using	Gibbs	free energy. For almost all ionic
solids of Group 1, are soluble in water due to the negative Gibbs free energy in the
solvation process.

```
Enthalpy	and	entropy	cycles	for	the	solvation	process	are	shown	below.

```

```
Using these two energy cycles, enthalpy and entropy change of solvation can be
calculated and these calculated values are given in Table 4.3. Free energy is calculated
using the equation,
Δ _GΘ_ = Δ _HΘ_ - T Δ _SΘ_

**4.2 Group 2 elements**
Group 2 elements are known as alkaline earth metals. They are less reactive than Group
1 metals due to its valence shell n _s_^2 electron configuration.

Both calcium and magnesium can be found naturally in dolomite (CaCO 3 .MgCO 3 ).

```
examples	of minerals with magnesium. Fluoroapatite [3(Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 ).CaF 2 ] and gypsum
(CaSO 4 .2H 2 O) are commercially important calcium contacting minerals.
```
```
4.2.1 Group trends
Beryllium and magnesium are greyish metals and other Group 2 metals are soft and
silvery in colour. Group	2	metal	oxides produce	basic	oxides except	for	BeO	which	shows	
amphoteric properties. Beryllium behaves similar to Al and this can be understood using
the diagonal relationship between Al and Be in the periodic table.
```
```
Elements	of Group 2 have higher densities and stronger metallic bonds compared to the
Group 1 metals. This is due to the availability of a greater number of electrons to form a
stronger metallic bond and their smaller size in atomic radii.
```
```
The first ionization energies of Group 2 elements are higher than that of Group 1 elements
due to their electron configuration of n s^2. Elements become more reactive and produce
+2	oxidation	state easily down the group. The properties of Group 2 elements are given
in Table 4.4.

4.2.3 Thermal stability of salts
Decomposition of nitrates
Upon heating, Group 2 nitrates behave much similar to lithium nitrate. Group 2 nitrates
decompose	to	produce	metal	oxide,	nitrogen	dioxide and oxygen.	All	Group	2	nitrates	are	
soluble in water.

```
2Mg(NO 3 ) 2 (s) 2MgO(s) + 4NO 2 (g) + O 2 (g)
```
```
Decomposition of carbonates
Thermal stability of these carbonates increases down the group. Thermal stability of these
carbonates increases with the size of the cation. The polarizing power of the cation
decreases down the group due to the decrease of charge density of the cation. Carbonate
anion attached to Mg2+ cation is highly polarized than that of carbonate attached to Ba2+.
Highly	polarized	carbonate	anion	can	undergo	decomposition	easily	and	this	explains	the	
lower decomposition temperature of MgCO 3 than that of BaCO 3 .The general
decomposition of metal carbonates is shown below.
```
```
MCO 3 MO + CO 2
Decomposition temperature increases from 540 °C for MgCO 3 to 1360 °C for BaCO 3.
```
```
Decomposition of bicarbonates
Group 2 hydrogen carbonates are only stable in aqueous solutions and solid Group 2
hydrogen carbonates are not stable at room temperature.
```
```
Ca(HCO 3 ) 2 (aq) CaCO 3 (s) + CO 2 (g) + H 2 O(l)
```
```
4.2.4 Solubility of Group 2 salts
Solubility of Group 2 salts changes depending on the compound. Some compounds such
as	nitrate,	nitrite,	halides,	hydroxides,	sulphides, bicarbonates all are soluble in water.
The	solubility	varies	down	the	group	for	certain	compounds	such	as	hydroxides,	sulphate,
sulphite, carbonate, phosphate and oxalate showing the patterns given in Table 4.5.
```
```
Salts of Group 2 metals with uninegative anions, such as chloride and nitrates are
generally soluble. However, salts formed with anions containing more than one negative
charge, such as carbonates and phosphates, are insoluble. All carbonates are insoluble
except	BeCO 3. Hydrogen carbonates are more soluble than carbonates. The solubility of
Group 2 sulphates changes from soluble to insoluble when comparing solubility from
MgSO 4 to BaSO 4 .	On	the	other	hand,	hydroxides	change	solubility	from	insoluble	to	
soluble	 when	 moving	 down	 the	 group.	 For	 example, Mg(OH) 2 is sparingly soluble
whereas Ba(OH) 2 is soluble and produces a strongly basic solution.

metals. The first member, B, of Group 13 is different from the other members due to its
smaller atomic radius. Boron shows a strong diagonal relationship with Si in Group 14.

4.3.2 Aluminium
Aluminium is the third most abundant element in the earth crust. The exposed surface of
aluminium produces a layer of Al 2 O 3. This layer makes aluminium resistant to further
reactions	with	oxygen.	Due	to	this	impermeable	layer,	Al	can be considered as a non-
reactive element with air.
```

reacts with both acids and bases. The equations for the reactions of Al with acids and
bases are given below.

```
Aluminium	ion	in	aqueous	solution	is	expected	to	be	present	as	hexaaquaaluminium ion.
However, hydrolysis of Al3+ produces [Al(OH 2 ) 5 (OH)]2+(pentaaquahydroxidoaluminium
ion) and then produces [Al(OH 2 ) 4 (OH) 2 ]+ (tetraaquadihydroxidoaluminium ion) as shown

aluminum	hydroxide.	With excess	 OH- ions,	the	precipitated	aluminum	hydroxide	is
converted to tetrahydroxidoaluminate complex	ion.

Group 13 elements can have six	electrons	in	their valence shell by forming three covalent
bonds due to their n _s_^2 n _p_^1 electron configuration. As a result, many of the Group 13
covalent compounds have an incomplete octet, so can act as Lewis acids to accept a pair
of electrons from a donor. These compounds with incomplete octet are called **electron
deficient compounds.** Both B and Al compounds with incomplete octet form dimers in
the gaseous phase to satisfy the octet rule (Figure 4.2).

4.4.1 Group trends
Due to the formation of covalent bond network structure, first three elements of group 14
have high melting points. Carbon is a nonmetal,whereas silicon and germanium are
metalloids. Last two elements in the group, tin and lead are metals.
```
```
Carbon can be found in the nature mainly in coal, crude oil, calcite (CaCO 3 ), CO 2 in air,
magnesite (MgCO 3 ) and dolomite (CaCO 3 ·MgCO 3 ). Graphite, diamond and fullerenes
are the allotropic forms of carbon. Fullerenes are recently found, and most well-known
fullerene is C 60 , buckminsterfullerene (or bucky-ball). Carbon is the basis of life and the
most important element in organic chemistry. Silicon and germanium are mainly used in
the semiconductor industries. In addition, silicon is heavily used in inorganic polymer
industry.

Diamond and graphite are composed of homoatomic (same atoms) latice structures.
Diamond ( sp^3 hybridized carbon, tetrahedral) has a cubic crystalline structure. Graphite
( sp^2 hybridized carbon, trigonal planar) has stacked two-dimensional carbon layers.
Carbon-carbon bonds in graphite are shorter than that of diamond (diamond 154 pm and
graphite 141 pm) due to the hybridization of carbon atoms. These two crystalline lattice
structures are hard however diamond structure is the strongest lattice. Graphite is an
electrical and a thermal conductor due to delocalizing π electrons (Figure 4.3).
Interactions between layers of carbon in graphite are weak and this makes graphite a good
lubricant.

**4.4.3 Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide**
Carbon	monoxide	is	a	colourless,	odourless, highly poisonous gas. Bond enthalpy of
carbon	monoxide	is	more	than	that	of	the	C=O double bond. In carbon	monoxide	CO	
bond length is shorter than that of a typical C=O double bond. This suggests that the
bonding	between	C	and	O	in	carbon	monoxide	is	not	a	typical	C=O double bond. It has a
triple bond nature between the two atoms of C and O. The Lewis structure of CO is shown
in Figure 4.5.

**4.5 Group 15 elements**

N 2 is greatly stable (inert) under normal conditions due to strong triple bond
(942 kJ mol-1). Except nitrogen, all the other elements exist as solids. The higher
electronegativity, the smaller atomic radius and the absence of _d_ orbitals make nitrogen
different from the other elements in the group.

elements behaves as	a	true	metal.	Both	oxygen	and	sulphur are non-metals and other
elements in the group show metallic and nonmetallic properties.		Only	oxygen	exists	as	a	
gas, and other elements in the group are solids. Except oxygen,	other	elements	in	the	
group can form even-numbered	oxidation	states	from	+6	to	-2. Stability of +6 and -2
oxidation	states	decreases	down	the	group	whereas	the	stability	of	the	+4	oxidation	state	
increases.

**4.6.2 Hydrides of Group 16**
Group 16 elements form simple hydrides with hydrogen. All of them are covalent
hydrides. The variation of selected properties down the group of hydrides are shown in
Table 4.11.

**Table 4.11** Selected properties of Group 16 hydrides

```
H 2 O H 2 S H 2 Se H 2 Te
Melting point/ °C 0.0 - 85.6 - 65.7 - 51
Boiling point/ °C 100.0 - 60.3 - 41.3 - 4
Bond length/ pm 96 134 146 169
Bond angle/ ° 104.5 92.1 91 90
```
Due	to	the	extensive	hydrogen	bonding,	H 2 O shows abnormally high boiling and melting
points than the other hydrides of the group. Water is the only non-poisonous hydride
among all the other hydrides of the group.

The observed varation in bond length of covalent hydrides is due to the increase of size
of the central atom. Therefore, bond length increases down the group.

The covalent bond angle decreases as you come down in the group due to the less
repulsion of the bonding electrons as a result of electronegativity of the central atom

**4.6.2 Hydrides of Group 16**
Group 16 elements form simple hydrides with hydrogen. All of them are covalent
hydrides. The variation of selected properties down the group of hydrides are shown in
Table 4.11.

**Table 4.11** Selected properties of Group 16 hydrides

```
H 2 O H 2 S H 2 Se H 2 Te
Melting point/ °C 0.0 - 85.6 - 65.7 - 51
Boiling point/ °C 100.0 - 60.3 - 41.3 - 4
Bond length/ pm 96 134 146 169
Bond angle/ ° 104.5 92.1 91 90
```
Due	to	the	extensive	hydrogen	bonding,	H 2 O shows abnormally high boiling and melting
points than the other hydrides of the group. Water is the only non-poisonous hydride
among all the other hydrides of the group.

The observed varation in bond length of covalent hydrides is due to the increase of size
of the central atom. Therefore, bond length increases down the group.

The covalent bond angle decreases as you come down in the group due to the less
repulsion of the bonding electrons as a result of electronegativity of the central atom

decreases down the group. In H 2 S, H 2 Se and H 2 Te the bond angles become close to 90°.
This may also suggest that almost pure p orbitals on selenium and tellurium especially
are used for binding with hydrogen.
```
```
4.6.3 Oxygen
Oxygen has two allotropes, dioxygen (O 2 ) and trioxygen (ozone, O 3 ). Dioxygen is a
colourless and an odourless gas which is slightly soluble in water. Ozone has a pungent
odour. Ozone has a bond angle of 111.5°. Structure of these two allotropes are shown
below.

Catalytic decomposition of potassium chlorate and hydrogen peroxide can be used to
produce oxygen.

Metals react with dioxygen to produce metal oxides. Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent
stronger than dioxygen. Ozone is used to disinfect water in many developed countries to
kill pathogens. Unlike chlorine, ozone does not produce any harmful byproducts in the
disinfection process.

4.6.4 Sulphur
Sulphur can be classified as it is explained below.

Unlike oxygen, sulphur forms single bonds with itself rather than double bonds. The most
commonly occurring allotrope is rhombic sulphur which is refered to as α-sulphur (α-S 8 ).

It has a crown shape with eight-membered ring that has a cyclic zigzag arrangement as
shown below. When heated above 93 °C, α-S 8 changes its packing arrangement to the
other commonly found form of monoclinic sulphur, β-sulphur (β-S 8 ). These two forms
are allotropes of each other.

```
Figure 4.12 (a) crown form of S 8 (b) Rhombic sulphur (c) Monoclinic sulphur
```
Crystalline form of rhombic and monoclinic sulphur consist of S 8 rings in the shape of
crown. These can be packed together in two different ways to form rhombic crystals and
to form needle shaped monoclinic crystals as shown above. Below 95 °C the rhombic
form is the most stable allotropic form of sulphur.

Amorphous sulphur is an elastic form of sulphur which is obtained by pouring melted
sulphur into water. Sudden cooling of molten sulphur converts liquid sulphur to
amorphous sulphur with open chains. With time, amorphous sulphur converts to
crystalline sulphur. The amorphous form of sulphur is malleable but it is unstable.

4.7 Group 17 elements
4.7.1 Group trends
Halogens are reactive and can only be found naturally as compounds. Fluorine is the most
electronegative element and	exhibits	-1	and	0	oxidation	states.	The halogens other than
fluorine	 form	 stable	 compounds	 corresponding	 to	 nearly	 all	 values	 of	 the	 oxidation	
numbers from -1 to +7. However, compounds	of	bromine	with	the	oxidation	state	of	+7	
are unstable. Due to the smaller atomic radius, fluorine can stabilize higher oxidation	
states of other elements.
```
```
Oxidizing	ability	of	halogens decreases down the group. Fluorine is a powerful	oxidizing	
agent. The	reactivity	of	halegons	decreases	down	the	group.	This	can	be	explained by
using the displacement reactions of halegons.

```
Fluorine and chlorine are gases with pale yellow and pale green colours respectively at
room temperature. Bromine is a red-brown fumming liquid and iodine is a violet-black
solid with lustrous effect.
```
```
The bond energy of F 2 (155 kJ mol-1) is less than that of Cl 2 (240 kJ mol-1) due to repulsion
between the non-bonded electron pairs of fluorine atoms. This is a reason for the high
reactivity of fluorine gas. Down the Group 17 bond energies show a gradual decrease
(Cl 2 = 240 kJ mol-1, Br 2 = 190 kJ mol-1 and I 2 = 149 kJ mol-1).

Hydrogen halides**
Hydrogen	halides	are	acidic	in	water.	HF	has	the	ability	to	produce	extensive	hydrogen	
bonding, however, HF is a gas (boiling point 20 °C) at room temperature and under

**Acidic nature of hydrogen halides in aqueous solutions**

For HF; HF(g) + H 2 O(l) H 3 O+(aq) + F-(aq)

For other hydrohen halides (HCl, HBr and HI);

HX(g) + H 2 O(l) H 3 O+(aq) + X-(aq)

HF is a weak acid whereas the other hydrogen halides are strong acids in the aqueous
medium. HF has the high bond energy (strongest covalent bond), which makes it difficult
to dissociate in water to produce H+ ions readily. The acidic strength of hydrogen halides
increases down the Group 17. This can	be	explained using the same fact mentioned above.

oxidation	number	of	the	chlorine	atom.	The	stuctures	and	the	oxidation	states	of	oxoacids	
are given in the Table 4 .16.

Oxidizing	power	of	oxoacids of chlorine is changed as follows.
HOCl > HClO 2 > HClO 3 > HClO 4
```
```
The	oxidation	state	of	chlorine	in	HClO,	HClO 2 , HClO 3 , HClO 4 respectively are +1, +3, +5
and	+7.	The	higher	the	oxidation	state	the	stronger	the	acid	will	be.	Therefore the variation
of acidic strength is HClO < HClO 2 < HClO 3 < HClO 4.

Reactions of oxoanions
ClO ̅ is stable at low temperatures and disproportionates at high temperature to produce
Cl ̅ and ClO 3 ̅. However, both BrO ̅ and IO ̅ are not stable even at low temperatures
and undergo disproportionation.

```
```
3ClO ̅ ClO 3 ̅ + 2Cl ̅

Under acidic conditions, HOCl is more stable than ClO ̅ , which makes disproportionation
predominant under basic conditions.

4.9.2 Metallic character
Metals have lower ionization energies compared to the other elements. Hence, metals can
easily release electrons to produce cations. The atomic radii increase and ionization
energy decreases when going down a group. Therefore, the metallic nature increases
down the group. Also, across a period, atomic radii decrease and ionization energy
increases. Therefore, the metallic nature decreases.

G.C. E. (A/L) CHEMISTRY: UNIT 6 Chemistry of s, p and d block elements
```
```
d Block Elements
```
```
Elements	in	Groups 3 to 12 are collectively classified as d block elements. In d block
elements the last electron gets filled into a d orbital. These elements can be categorised
into two categories namely transition and non-transition.
```
```
4.10 Transition elements
d block elements contain incompletely filled d subshell at elemental state or with
the ability to form at least one stable ion with incompletely filled d subshell are
called transition elements. Therefore, d block elements producing ions only
with d^10 configurations are considered as non-transition elements.
e.g.: Electronic	configurations	of	Zn	 : [Ar]3 d^104 s^2
```
```
Electronic	configurations of Zn2+: [Ar]3 d^104 s^0
```
```
Electronic	configuration	of	Sc	 : [Ar]3 d^14 s^2
```
```
Electronic	configuration	of	Sc3+ : [Ar]3 d^04 s^0
```
```
Both Zn and Sc are d block elements (last electron is filled to a 3 d orbital). However, Zn
is considered as a non-transition element due to the absence of a partially filled d
subshell at the elemental stage and Zn2+ ion. Sc can be considered as a transition element
since Sc contains partially filed d subshell at the elemental stage.

Transition metal ions have less variation in atomic radii across a period than that of the
main group elements. Across the period of the transition metals shown in Table 4.23, the
atomic radii decrease slightly and then increase. Across the period, to each d electron
added nuclear charge is also increased by one. The decrease of the atomic radii at the
middle of the period (from Sc to Ni) occurs due to the predominance of attraction power
of nuclear charge increase than the repulsion among the electrons. However, at the end of
the period (Cu and Zn), radii of the atoms increase due to greater repulsion among
electrons as electrons are paired in d orbitals.

**4.10.1 Occurrence**
Elements	on	the	left of the 3 _d_ series (fourth period _d_ block elements) exist commonly in
the	nature	as	metal	oxides and cations combined with anions.

Few	examples	are	shown	below.

**4.10.2 Properties of fourth period** **_d_** **block elements
Oxidation states and ionization energies**
Except	Sc	and	Zn	in	the	fourth	period	 _d_ block elements, others can form stable cations
with	multiple	oxidation	states.	The multiplicity of	the	oxidation	state	is	due	to	the	varying	
number of _d_ electrons participate in bonding. Both Zn (+2) and Sc (+3) only produce ions
with	a	single	oxidation	state,	and	these	ions	do	not	contain	partially	filled	 _d_ orbitals.
Electron	configuration	and	the	oxidation	states	of	 _d_ block elements are shown in Table
4.26. Sc forms only Sc3+ ions.	Except	in Sc,	+2	oxidation	number can be seen in all the
other elements since electrons in 4 _s_ orbital get removed due to ionization before electrons
in 3 _d_ orbitals. Reason for this is that the 4 _s_ orbital with two electrons in the outermost
shell experiences	a lesser effective nuclear charge than that of electrons in the _3d_ orbital.

As a result of the 3 _d_^104 _s_^1 configuration, Cu can form +1	oxidation	number commonly.
However, Cr+ is	extremely	rare and unstable even though Cr has 3 _d_^54 _s_^1 configuration.

The	highest	possible	oxidation	number that a d block element can show is the sum of 4 _s_
and 3 _d_ electrons.	Transition	metals	are	also	capable	of	producing	variable	oxidation	states	
similar to _p_ block	elements	and	show	the	ability	to	interconvert	among	their	oxidation	
states. Therefore, they	can	act	as	oxidizing	as	well	as	reducing	agents.	

First	five	elements	achieve	the	maximum	possible	oxidation	state	by	losing	all	4 _s_ and 3 _d_
electrons. With the filling of more 3 _d_ electrons, towards the right end of the period, the
3 _d_ orbitals become greater in energy as the nuclear charge of the atom increases. This
makes _d_ electrons are harder	to	remove.	The	most	common	oxidation	state	for	these	
elements is +2 due to the loss of 4 _s_ electrons.

**Reactivity**
_d_ block elements do not react with the water while _s_ block elements react with water
vigorously. The 4 _s_ electrons of the _d_ block elements are tightly bound to the nucleus due

Ionization energies of fourth period d block elements are higher than that of the s block
elements in the same period. The first ionization energies of d block elements are increase
slightly across the period when move from left to the right of the period. Variation of the
first ionization energy across the d block is less than that of s and p block elements.
Increase in the nuclear charge across the fourth period d block elements expect	to	be	
increase the first ionization energies due to the greater attraction towards the nucleus by
the 4 s electrons. However, in all d block	elements,	extra	electrons	are	inserted	in	to	the	
3 d orbital moving from left to right across the period, and these d electrons shield the 4s
electrons from the inward attraction of the nucleus. Because of these two counter effects,
the ionization energy of d block elements increases slightly across the period. Successive
ionization energies of the fourth period d block elements are shown in the table given
below.

** For K, only first and second ionization energies are given to understand the energy
increase due to removal of an electron from an inner orbital.

First ionization energies of _d_ block elements are higher than those of _s_ block elements in
the same period. This	explains	the	less	reactivity	of	 _d_ block elements than the _s_ block
elements.

All _d_ block elements are metals because 4 _s_ electrons in _d_ block elements can be released
easily to form cations. Metallic character of the _d_ block elements increases down the
group.

All _d_ block elements in the fourth period are solids with high melting and boiling points.
Melting and boiling points of _d_ block elements are	extremely	high	as	compared	to	those	
of _s_ and _p_ block elements. _d_ block elements are moderately reactive.

Except metal ions with 3 _d_^0 and 3 _d_^10 configurations, _d_ block metal compounds produce
characteristic colours.	This	means	transition	metal	ion	complexes	can	produce	coloured
compounds. Most _d_ block metal ions form complex compounds.

**Electronegativity**
Table below provides the electronegativity of _d_ block elements and can be used to
understand the variation of electronegativity of _d_ block elements in the fourth period.
Electronegativity increases with the atomic number. However, Mn and Zn are deviated
from the trend due to their stable electron configuration. Due to the higher nuclear charge,
_d_ block elements have higher electronegativity than that of the _s_ block elements.

of Fe(II) and Fe(III).

oxidation	number.	The	change	in	the	bonding	type	explains	the	basis	in	the acid-base

Reactions of some selected oxoanions of chromium

conditions, it is converted to the orange coloured dichromate ion.

Even	without	partially	filled	 d subshells (Cr	at	+6	oxidation	state),	both	chromate	and	
dichromate produce colours due to the electron charge transfer between Cr and O ligands.
However, the	explanation	of	this	phenomena is not a part of the current syllabus.

The reduction of Cr 2 O 7 2- to Cr3+ happens only in acidic medium. In acidic medium, CrO 4 2-
ions will be converted into Cr 2 O 7 2- ions. Therefore in acidic medium Cr6+ present only as
Cr 2 O 7 2-.

**4.10.6 Nomenclature of simple complex ions and compounds**
Name of a metal complex	provides	information	about	the	complex	such	as oxidation state
of the central metal ion, types of ligands and the number. The rules used to write the name
of a complex	ion is proposed by IUPAC are given below.

**Naming of ligands**
Name of an anion acting as a ligand in the complex	ion can be obtained by removing last
letter of the anion name and adding ‘ _o_ ’ letter to the end. Neut ral molecules acting as
ligands are usually given the name of the molecule. However, there	are	some	exceptions
and those are not discussed in the current G.	C.	E.	(A/L) Chemistry syllabus.

```
Anionic ligands Neutral ligands
Cl ̅ chlorido NH 3 ammine
Br ̅ bromido H 2 O aqua
CN ̅ cyanido CO carbonyl
OH ̅ hydroxido
```
Number of a particular ligand is indicated by prefixes.	The	used	prefixes	are	 _di_ – two, _tri_

- three, _tetra_ – four, _penta_ – five, _hexa_ – six,	etc.

**Naming of complex cations**
Name	of	the	complex	ion	must	be	written	as	a	single	word	with no space and must only
be	written	using	lower	case	English	letters.	Oxidation number of the metal ion is indicated
by Roman numerals within parentheses at the end of the metal name.

e. g.: [Ni(NH 3 ) 6 ]2+ hexaamminenickel(II) ion

[Cu(NH 3 ) 4 ]2+ tetraamminecopper(II) ion

[Cr(H 2 O) 6 ]3+ hexaaquachromium(III)	ion

**Complex anions**
For	negatively	charged	complex	ions	(complex	anions)	the suffix	‘ _ate_ ’ must be used after
the name of the metal.

e.g.: [CuC 14 ]2- tetrachloridocuprate(II) ion

```
[CoCl 4 ]2- tetrachloridocobaltate(II) ion

**4.10.6 Nomenclature of simple complex ions and compounds**
Name of a metal complex	provides	information	about	the	complex	such	as oxidation state
of the central metal ion, types of ligands and the number. The rules used to write the name
of a complex	ion is proposed by IUPAC are given below.

**Naming of ligands**
Name of an anion acting as a ligand in the complex	ion can be obtained by removing last
letter of the anion name and adding ‘ _o_ ’ letter to the end. Neut ral molecules acting as
ligands are usually given the name of the molecule. However, there	are	some	exceptions
and those are not discussed in the current G.	C.	E.	(A/L) Chemistry syllabus.

```
Anionic ligands Neutral ligands
Cl ̅ chlorido NH 3 ammine
Br ̅ bromido H 2 O aqua
CN ̅ cyanido CO carbonyl
OH ̅ hydroxido
```
Number of a particular ligand is indicated by prefixes.	The	used	prefixes	are	 _di_ – two, _tri_

- three, _tetra_ – four, _penta_ – five, _hexa_ – six,	etc.

**Naming of complex cations**
Name	of	the	complex	ion	must	be	written	as	a	single	word	with no space and must only
be	written	using	lower	case	English	letters.	Oxidation number of the metal ion is indicated
by Roman numerals within parentheses at the end of the metal name.

e. g.: [Ni(NH 3 ) 6 ]2+ hexaamminenickel(II) ion

[Cu(NH 3 ) 4 ]2+ tetraamminecopper(II) ion

[Cr(H 2 O) 6 ]3+ hexaaquachromium(III)	ion

**Complex anions**
For	negatively	charged	complex	ions	(complex	anions)	the suffix	‘ _ate_ ’ must be used after
the name of the metal.

e.g.: [CuC 14 ]2- tetrachloridocuprate(II) ion

```
[CoCl 4 ]2- tetrachloridocobaltate(II) ion
```
```

anionic complexes
```
```
Metal Name used in
anionic complexes
Cr chromate Co cobaltate
Cu cuprate Fe ferrate
Mn manganate Ni nickelate
Ag argentate Hg mercurate
Au aurate
```
```
Name of a complex	compound must have the name of the cation first and the anion name
second. These two names must be separated by a space.
```
```
e.g.: [Ni(NH 3 ) 6 ]Cl 2 - hexaamminenickel(II) chloride
```
```
Na 2 [CoCl 4 ] - sodium tetrachloridocobaltate(II)
```
```
Coordination number
```
```
Number of coordination bonds formed between the central metal ion and ligands is
defined as coordination number. Since some ligands can form more than one coordination
bond with the central metal ion, it is incorrect to define the coordination number as the
number of ligands coordinated to the central metal ion. The coordination number depends
on the size, charge, nature of ligands and the electronic configuration of the central metal
ion.

4.10.7 Factors affecting the colour of the complexes
Transition metal atoms and ions can produce coloured complexes.	 Colour	 of	 these	
complexes	depends on the	following	factors.	Examples	which reflect the effect these
factors are given in Table 4.34.

**4.10.8 Importance of** **_d_** **block elements**

1. Transition metals are good conductors (Au, Ag and Cu), and are also malleable,
    ductile,	and	lustrous.	Transition	metals	can	be	mixed	together	to	produce	alloys	
    since they have similar atomic sizes. These alloys are used since the ancient time
    for various purposes. Production of alloys can change the properties of metals.
2. Cobalt isotope^60 Co is widely used as a radiation source in radiotherapy.
3. Transition metal atoms and ions are used to develop compounds with catalytic
    properties that are widely used in different industries as catalyst.
4. Since transition metals can form various coloured compounds, they are used as
    pigments for the production of paint. They are also used to produce coloured
    glasses and glass bottles.
5. _d_ block elements such as Ni and Cd are used to produce rechargeable batteries.
6. They are used in the production of compounds such as cadmium telluride
    (CdTe) and copper indium diselenide in photovoltaic cells. Solar cell is an
    example	for	a	photovoltaic cell.
